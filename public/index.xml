      <title>The Importance of (Daily) Technique</title>

      <description>Originally posted on performing.design
As professional artists, we’re expected to practice our craft every single day. For dancers, the main way to do this is to spend time in class (for most of us, that’s every day, if not several times a day; full-time dancers are usually in class or in the studio 6–10 hours per day, 5–6 days a week). Aside from the physical exercise (which is an important element for performing artists), all of this time spent doing roughly the same thing has many benefits and side-effects.</description>

      <title>An Intro to Embodied Cognition</title>

      <description>Originally posted on performing.design
Underneath a lot of what we cover in performing.design is embodied cognition, a fairly recent development psychology and cognitive science. Embodied Cognition seeks to explore the relationship between how we use our bodies and how we think/what our brains do. It’s about looking at a thinking organism holistically as opposed to focusing on the brain, including the motor system, perceptual system, and the body’s interaction with the current environment.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  There are an incredibly small number of people who have professional experience in both performing arts and the tech design. Applying practices, concepts, theories, and lessons from performing arts can yield some really interesting insights and experiments for the design community. Follow along at http://performing.design   I&amp;rsquo;ve been quiet lately, and that&amp;rsquo;s largely due to my recent move to NYC. Madison was great, but it was time for me to find new challenges and a new home, and NYC is the natural choice given my careers in both tech and dance.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Industry Experience</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/the-case-against-industry-experience/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/the-case-against-industry-experience/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  While having experience working in a professional setting is important, there&#39;s a danger to only hiring people with experience in your specific industry. Having a fresh set of eyes on something can be incredibly valuable/important, and helps combat bias and theory blindness. Good designers are expert learners. We expect to need to understand the nuances of a new area of expertise.   For those that haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping track, I recently (October 2017) moved from Madison, WI to Brooklyn, NY, and the difference in the tech industry between the two cities has been really interesting.</description>

      <title>Life Lessons from Curling</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/life-lessons-from-curling/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Curling is a game about communication and adapting on the fly. Things don&#39;t always go perfectly as planned, so you need to be able to react. Never give up on a stone. It might look grim, but you never know what might happen and how you might be able to use something. The Spirit of Curling is really what it&#39;s all about. It&#39;s not whether you win or lose.</description>

      <title>What Designers Need to Know About Development</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/what-designers-need-to-know-about-development/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/what-designers-need-to-know-about-development/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  There&#39;s a lot of discussion around whether designers should code. Here&#39;s my take on it. Short answer: No, but you should be aware of the technology. As a designer, having at least a vague idea of how the technology behind the products you&#39;re working on is beneficial, both in terms of the design work you do and in communicating with other team members. There may be certain quirks based on implementation, but overall the pattern is Database -- Server-side -- (API) -- (Middleware) -- Front-End -- Visual/UI Design   It seems that everyone has an opinion on whether designers should code.</description>

      <title>Rochester Review Master Class: Revisited</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/rochester-review-master-class-revisited/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  In the early days of software, having a product that worked was good enough. Nowadays design is the differentiator. There are multiple factors to a good design: learnability, efficiency, flexibility, aesthetics. The study of human-centered design isn&#39;t new. The same concepts that Jakob Nielsen covered in the 1980s ring true today.   In 2015, I was interviewed for the Rochester Review, my alma mater&amp;rsquo;s quarterly publication for parents and alumni.</description>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/usability-research-checklist/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  A lot more goes into designing and running your own usability tests than people typically think. Being properly prepared can be the difference between great success and catastrophic failure for your user research. Don&#39;t underestimate how much time, energy, and resource setting up a proper usability study takes.

      <title>An Open (Love) Letter To My Next Work Partner</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/an-open-love-letter-to-my-next-work-partner/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Transparency is paramount. Make sure there are stated objectives (even if they&#39;re inaccurate), daily check-ins, and quarterly reviews. Flexibility empowers your people to do the best work they can. Have a bias against policies, rules, and meetings. Trust is your most powerful tool. Get a bunch of good people together, point them in a direction, and get out of the way.   One of the myriad benefits of having spent so much time working as a contractor is the variety of cultures, work practices, and methodologies employed by various companies.</description>

      <title>UX Considerations For IoT</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/ux-considerations-for-iot/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/ux-considerations-for-iot/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Latency and reliability can be a major issue. You should include some sort of manual control (interface or cable). Tech literacy is another concern, especially as IoT products continue to move into the home and gain mainstream adoption. Be aware of your brand experience across all communication modalities (print, mobile, physical).   Internet of Things (IoT) has been all the rage for a hot second as more and more companies try to bring their devices online and increase access (and functionality) to customers, but it&amp;rsquo;s far too easy for things to go wrong.</description>

      <title>Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts of Corporate Innovation</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/dos-and-donts-of-corporate-innovation/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  There&#39;s a ton of potential in the corporate innovation world, and as the venture market cools, the future of early stage might be corporate. Innovation teams need certain special rules and freedoms compared to the core business, especially in highly regulated industries. Culture and environment are the most important things to define and develop in these settings. Don&#39;t settle, and don&#39;t let corporate culture interfere.   As some of you may know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time working in the corporate innovation team of a Fortune 500 company.</description>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/why-were-firing-a-top-tier-product-development-firm/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Culture trumps credentials, reputation, and pretty much everything else. Don&#39;t be afraid to pull the plug on something if it isn&#39;t working. Trust your gut and stick to your guns. If you want something done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Just because it has a corporate name tag doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t talented people.   Some of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing recently has been with what&amp;rsquo;s known as the Business Development branch of a large company.</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  Migrating a legacy platform to a cloud-bases SaaS model provides unique challenges and opportunities for product growth/clarification. Surveys and interviews are powerful tools for getting context and putting the product team in the proper frame of mind. Nothing beats testing a solution in the wild. We learned a lot by running potential solutions by users and by putting it in their hands to interact with.   Background SingleWire is a leader in the emergency notification space.</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  Getting in at the ground level on IoT projects is incredibly valuable, as it allowed us to guide the client and product development and avoid legacy. IoT products have an extra layer of complexity in that you have to ensure the application, server, and device are all communicating properly and forming a cohesive experience. There are unique challenges when researching and designing for industrial IoT applications, including assess to end users, a lot of subject matter expertise, and connectivity issues.</description>

      <title>The Dangers of Tight Iteration</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Getting a lot of feedback quickly isn&#39;t necessarily always the best strategy - having a guiding light is helpful as well. Users react to the level of fidelity of what you show them. You might be missing something if your fidelity doesn&#39;t match the issue in the design. Good Product Design (or at least, a good discovery phase/project plan) can alleviate these issues.   Before starting a new engagement with a client, I always ask a series of questions about their company, their processes, and the project I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on.</description>

      <title>Product vs Project Management</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  There&#39;s still a fair amount of confusion between product management and project management. Lots of people do the latter well, but the former is often forgotten/forgone. Project Management is focused on execution - securing and organizing resources, planning out tasks, and keeping things on track. Velocity. How. When. Product Management is more about vision - understanding what your users are trying to achieve, having a sense of the big picture, and making sure what&#39;s being created fits expectations and needs.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Ionic lets you build apps ridiculously fast. Write once, build many. If you don&#39;t like how something&#39;s done, instead of just complaining about it, do something to make it better. Reverse engineering is easier than ever. Your success is not a factor of your codebase, but about the value you offer an end-user.

      <description>TL;DNR  Static generators (e.g. Hugo) are pretty cool. Ease of use/production directly relates to content creation. It&#39;s okay to borrow aesthetics/technologies/designs from others.   As you might be able to tell, my last blog post is from 2014. It was about time to get back on the blog horse but also give the site a little facelift. I&amp;rsquo;d migrated blog platforms in the past, but never really took the time to think about how my own personal site was hosted.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Notification design is important, especially in the light of ubiquitous computing. Designing to allow interrupted attention is crucial. Context matters: Users are no longer in a room at a desk on a computer.   With all the talk about unplugging, disconnecting, screen time, and going &amp;ldquo;off the grid&amp;rdquo;, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly been a shift in the way we interact with technology and the implications it has for society (as well as possibly our mental health).</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  You can learn a ton while on lunch break by asking the right questions/giving the right instructions and sending it off for remote unmoderated testing. A properly orchestrated user-centered/iterative design process can provide value for many projects, including marketing websites. Although it was early in my career and the mentorship was useful, I much prefer full-blown applications to these types of eCommerce/marketing/brochure sites that Candorem is known for.</description>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/showcase/nextt/</guid>
      <description>Lessons Learned  Never underestimate the value of guerrilla UX research. Instead of spending hours debating something internally, put together a survey and put it on Reddit. Use the resources and data available to you. Utilizing a well-defined analytics suite to define funnels and focus on problem points and in-depth user research to discover why people are falling off at that point can have tremendous impacts on conversion/success rates. Mark&#39;s postmortem covers a lot of what we learned and expresses similar sentiments to what I had as we closed down Nextt.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  OkCupid is great, but it&#39;s broken. Fixing it should be pretty easy &amp;mdash; just give a fast, simple way to stop bad members from being bad, and let the community sort it out. Empower your users and they&#39;ll empower you.   Dear OkCupid,
I love you. Well, maybe not so much love anymore. I really like you. I really like how you&amp;rsquo;ve made your services free for everyone, and how you&amp;rsquo;re helping people connect and meet others that they never would.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Pop-ups are distracting. Design your life to have less sudden distractions and you&#39;ll be more productive and happier. Desiging user experiences that encourage flow are good.   I&amp;rsquo;ve become more and more interested in Flow recently. As a psych major, flow is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of for a long time, but I always thought of it as something that just happens, and never gave it much thought.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Foursquare&#39;s API and Google Maps are pretty easy to work with. Creating a new product can be as easy as combining two existing technologies. New products create opportunities for new experiences.   A little over a month ago (technically during the Foursquare Hackathon, but I was working from home due to Red Eye) I spent a few hours one weekend hacking together an idea I&amp;rsquo;d come up with when working on Foursquare integration for Trinker.</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  You can teach an old dog (pun intended) new tricks: teaching a 20-year-old organization how to be more agile has its benefits. Interactive multimedia (&#34;environmental graphic design&#34;) is a unique design/technology challenge, and while testing is important, it&#39;s mostly in the form of dogfooding. Your users, in this setting, are passersby. They have no idea what you&#39;re building, and there aren&#39;t any trends to rely on, so designing for discoverability is crucial.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Memory is fallible, and humans tend to remember the most intense part and the ending of any experience. Finding systems that work for you is essential to productivity. Limit the number of choices a user has to (or has the opportunity to) make. Choose smart defaults and hide most options.   I have a habit when it comes to books. When I read a book, I almost always underline/take notes in the margin.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Content is just as important to UX as aesthetics. Without content, your site (and all of its functionality and pretty design) is worthless. Trying to stay up to date with blog posts is hard.   I&amp;rsquo;m going to say this straight out of the gates: this blog post is kind of a cop-out. There have been a ton of changes in my life lately, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little MIA when it comes to this blog.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Sometimes things we interact with in the physical world are poorly designed. Direct mapping makes a lot more sense, and should be used whenever/wherever possible. Just because people are used to a certain design/solution does not mean it&#39;s the optimal. Don&#39;t be afraid to start from scratch.   Sometimes we come across things that, until we see an alternative, we don&amp;rsquo;t realize there&amp;rsquo;s something better than the current option.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Drupal is cool, powerful, mature. Making it easier to create content is important to how likely it is to happen. Keeping up with technology and the design community is important.   It only took me about 10 months, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to rebuilding this site to have a purpose. I originally built a personal website when I was leaving Epic with the intention of having a place to show my past work as well as a place to play around with new technologies on the web.</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  Healthcare is a particularly challenging industry to be a designer in, as the users/customers are change/risk averse and there are many regulations to have to grapple with. It can be incredibly difficult to enact change in large organizations, and the best approach is usually to run a small pilot program and gradually expand it. Though it was my first job out of undergrad, I learned quickly that this wasn&#39;t an environment I wanted to be in, and that I much prefer smaller teams with bigger impact.</description>
