      <description>TL;DNR  There are an incredibly small number of people who have professional experience in both performing arts and the tech design. Applying practices, concepts, theories, and lessons from performing arts can yield some really interesting insights and experiments for the design community. Follow along at http://performing.design   I&amp;rsquo;ve been quiet lately, and that&amp;rsquo;s largely due to my recent move to NYC. Madison was great, but it was time for me to find new challenges and a new home, and NYC is the natural choice given my careers in both tech and dance.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Industry Experience</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/the-case-against-industry-experience/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/the-case-against-industry-experience/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  While having experience working in a professional setting is important, there&#39;s a danger to only hiring people with experience in your specific industry. Having a fresh set of eyes on something can be incredibly valuable/important, and helps combat bias and theory blindness. Good designers are expert learners. We expect to need to understand the nuances of a new area of expertise.   For those that haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping track, I recently (October 2017) moved from Madison, WI to Brooklyn, NY, and the difference in the tech industry between the two cities has been really interesting.</description>

      <title>Rochester Review Master Class: Revisited</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  In the early days of software, having a product that worked was good enough. Nowadays design is the differentiator. There are multiple factors to a good design: learnability, efficiency, flexibility, aesthetics. The study of human-centered design isn&#39;t new. The same concepts that Jakob Nielsen covered in the 1980s ring true today.   In 2015, I was interviewed for the Rochester Review, my alma mater&amp;rsquo;s quarterly publication for parents and alumni.</description>

      <title>Usability Research Checklist</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  A lot more goes into designing and running your own usability tests than people typically think. Being properly prepared can be the difference between great success and catastrophic failure for your user research. Don&#39;t underestimate how much time, energy, and resource setting up a proper usability study takes.   MobileIgniter asked me to put together a checklist of everything needed to properly set up and run studies in a usability lab.</description>

      <title>An Open (Love) Letter To My Next Work Partner</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/an-open-love-letter-to-my-next-work-partner/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Transparency is paramount. Make sure there are stated objectives (even if they&#39;re inaccurate), daily check-ins, and quarterly reviews. Flexibility empowers your people to do the best work they can. Have a bias against policies, rules, and meetings. Trust is your most powerful tool. Get a bunch of good people together, point them in a direction, and get out of the way.   One of the myriad benefits of having spent so much time working as a contractor is the variety of cultures, work practices, and methodologies employed by various companies.</description>

      <title>UX Considerations For IoT</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/ux-considerations-for-iot/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/ux-considerations-for-iot/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Latency and reliability can be a major issue. You should include some sort of manual control (interface or cable). Tech literacy is another concern, especially as IoT products continue to move into the home and gain mainstream adoption. Be aware of your brand experience across all communication modalities (print, mobile, physical).   Internet of Things (IoT) has been all the rage for a hot second as more and more companies try to bring their devices online and increase access (and functionality) to customers, but it&amp;rsquo;s far too easy for things to go wrong.</description>

      <title>Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts of Corporate Innovation</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/dos-and-donts-of-corporate-innovation/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  There&#39;s a ton of potential in the corporate innovation world, and as the venture market cools, the future of early stage might be corporate. Innovation teams need certain special rules and freedoms compared to the core business, especially in highly regulated industries. Culture and environment are the most important things to define and develop in these settings. Don&#39;t settle, and don&#39;t let corporate culture interfere.   As some of you may know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time working in the corporate innovation team of a Fortune 500 company.</description>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/why-were-firing-a-top-tier-product-development-firm/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Culture trumps credentials, reputation, and pretty much everything else. Don&#39;t be afraid to pull the plug on something if it isn&#39;t working. Trust your gut and stick to your guns. If you want something done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Just because it has a corporate name tag doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t talented people.   Some of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing recently has been with what&amp;rsquo;s known as the Business Development branch of a large company.</description>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/showcase/singlewire-software/</guid>
      <description>Background SingleWire is a leader in the emergency notification space. SingleWire&amp;rsquo;s main product, InformaCast, is trusted by federal agencies, major universities, and large companies. Traditionally deployed via Cisco phones, email, and desktop software, in 2016 SingleWire was in the midst of a transition to mobile. They needed research to understand mobile use cases and to help brainstorm functionality for a mobile application.
Method SingleWire’s new Active Tracking mobile application had to major goals: 1) to allow members of a community to receive InformaCast notifications on the go (as opposed to via phone, desktop, or email), and 2) to allow users to send a distress signal, notifying authorities that they need help.</description>

      <description>About Therma-Stor is a high-end dehumidifier, water heater, and disaster recovery/restoration manufacturer established in 1977. Most of their products are focused on commercial applications, but recently they’ve been expanding into the high-end residential space with some of their units. With that move they were also interested in bringing their products online to offer internet-enabled options.
With so many examples of IoT products gone wrong, and all the ways one can go wrong, the opportunity to get in on the ground level of taking a product online is extremely valuable.</description>

      <title>The Dangers of Tight Iteration</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2016 19:31:28 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Getting a lot of feedback quickly isn&#39;t necessarily always the best strategy - having a guiding light is helpful as well. Users react to the level of fidelity of what you show them. You might be missing something if your fidelity doesn&#39;t match the issue in the design. Good Product Design (or at least, a good discovery phase/project plan) can alleviate these issues.   Before starting a new engagement with a client, I always ask a series of questions about their company, their processes, and the project I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on.</description>

      <title>Product vs Project Management</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  There&#39;s still a fair amount of confusion between product management and project management. Lots of people do the latter well, but the former is often forgotten/forgone. Project Management is focused on execution - securing and organizing resources, planning out tasks, and keeping things on track. Velocity. How. When. Product Management is more about vision - understanding what your users are trying to achieve, having a sense of the big picture, and making sure what&#39;s being created fits expectations and needs.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Ionic lets you build apps ridiculously fast. Write once, build many. If you don&#39;t like how something&#39;s done, instead of just complaining about it, do something to make it better. Reverse engineering is easier than ever. Your success is not a factor of your codebase, but about the value you offer an end-user.

      <description>TL;DNR  Static generators (e.g. Hugo) are pretty cool. Ease of use/production directly relates to content creation. It&#39;s okay to borrow aesthetics/technologies/designs from others.   As you might be able to tell, my last blog post is from 2014. It was about time to get back on the blog horse but also give the site a little facelift. I&amp;rsquo;d migrated blog platforms in the past, but never really took the time to think about how my own personal site was hosted.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Notification design is important, especially in the light of ubiquitous computing. Designing to allow interrupted attention is crucial. Context matters: Users are no longer in a room at a desk on a computer.   With all the talk about unplugging, disconnecting, screen time, and going &amp;ldquo;off the grid&amp;rdquo;, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly been a shift in the way we interact with technology and the implications it has for society (as well as possibly our mental health).</description>

      <description>Background Nextt was a collaborative social planning tool. Nextt&amp;rsquo;s goal was to make it easier to plan social events for 4-10 people within the next 14 days, and the service did so by allowing users to create and share event Ideas that, once the date/time, location, and attendees were finalized, transitioned into a Plan. If the Idea did not reach fruition within a preset amount of time, it would self-destruct, forcing the user to take action.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Pop-ups are distracting. Design your life to have less sudden distractions and you&#39;ll be more productive and happier. Desiging user experiences that encourage flow are good.   I&amp;rsquo;ve become more and more interested in Flow recently. As a psych major, flow is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of for a long time, but I always thought of it as something that just happens, and never gave it much thought.</description>

New products create opportunities for new experiences.

      <description>TL;DNR  Memory is fallible, and humans tend to remember the most intense part and the ending of any experience. Finding systems that work for you is essential to productivity. Limit the number of choices a user has to (or has the opportunity to) make. Choose smart defaults and hide most options.   I have a habit when it comes to books. When I read a book, I almost always underline/take notes in the margin.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Content is just as important to UX as aesthetics. Without content, your site (and all of its functionality and pretty design) is worthless. Trying to stay up to date with blog posts is hard.   I&amp;rsquo;m going to say this straight out of the gates: this blog post is kind of a cop-out.

      <description>TL;DNR  Sometimes things we interact with in the physical world are poorly designed. Direct mapping makes a lot more sense, and should be used whenever/wherever possible. Just because people are used to a certain design/solution does not mean it&#39;s the optimal. Don&#39;t be afraid to start from scratch.   Sometimes we come across things that, until we see an alternative, we don&amp;rsquo;t realize there&amp;rsquo;s something better than the current option.</description>
