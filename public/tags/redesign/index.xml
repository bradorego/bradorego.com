&lt;h1 id=&#34;about:7d17b5de2bae6f85a1bc96bad5421a8e&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Studio Etc. (&amp;ldquo;etc&amp;rdquo;) is an architectural design firm headquarted in Madison, WI with over 30 years of design and consulting experience. etc&amp;rsquo;s work is featured all over Madison, greater Wisconsin, and even other areas of the country such as Illinois, Arizona, and California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc&amp;rsquo;s former website was a flat set of three pages which left the user with virtually no idea of what the company actually was/did. The &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page was the only way to glean any real information, and the design was dominated by an image that had very little value-add. Within a course of a couple weeks, the entire brand identity, look and feel, and design of the website was turned around (with the help and incredible energy of the client).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new website features responsive design, a fluid layout, image slideshows (with lightbox for greater detail), and three structured subsections of the website (about, &amp;ldquo;what we do&amp;rdquo; (aka projects), and &amp;ldquo;on the boards&amp;rdquo; (aka blog)). The new look aligns with etc&amp;rsquo;s new identity, and provides a modern website to carry the company forward while making edits and updates easy via Drupal&amp;rsquo;s admin interface.&lt;/p&gt;
