      <description>Lessons Learned  Migrating a legacy platform to a cloud-bases SaaS model provides unique challenges and opportunities for product growth/clarification. Surveys and interviews are powerful tools for getting context and putting the product team in the proper frame of mind. Nothing beats testing a solution in the wild. We learned a lot by running potential solutions by users and by putting it in their hands to interact with.   Background SingleWire is a leader in the emergency notification space.</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  Getting in at the ground level on IoT projects is incredibly valuable, as it allowed us to guide the client and product development and avoid legacy. IoT products have an extra layer of complexity in that you have to ensure the application, server, and device are all communicating properly and forming a cohesive experience. There are unique challenges when researching and designing for industrial IoT applications, including assess to end users, a lot of subject matter expertise, and connectivity issues.</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  Never underestimate the value of guerrilla UX research. Instead of spending hours debating something internally, put together a survey and put it on Reddit. Use the resources and data available to you. Utilizing a well-defined analytics suite to define funnels and focus on problem points and in-depth user research to discover why people are falling off at that point can have tremendous impacts on conversion/success rates. Mark&#39;s postmortem covers a lot of what we learned and expresses similar sentiments to what I had as we closed down Nextt.</description>
