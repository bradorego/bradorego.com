      <description>Background SingleWire is a leader in the emergency notification space. SingleWire&amp;rsquo;s main product, InformaCast, is trusted by federal agencies, major universities, and large companies. Traditionally deployed via Cisco phones, email, and desktop software, in 2016 SingleWire was in the midst of a transition to mobile. They needed research to understand mobile use cases and to help brainstorm functionality for a mobile application.
Method SingleWire’s new Active Tracking mobile application had to major goals: 1) to allow members of a community to receive InformaCast notifications on the go (as opposed to via phone, desktop, or email), and 2) to allow users to send a distress signal, notifying authorities that they need help.</description>

      <description>About Therma-Stor is a high-end dehumidifier, water heater, and disaster recovery/restoration manufacturer established in 1977. Most of their products are focused on commercial applications, but recently they’ve been expanding into the high-end residential space with some of their units. With that move they were also interested in bringing their products online to offer internet-enabled options.
With so many examples of IoT products gone wrong, and all the ways one can go wrong, the opportunity to get in on the ground level of taking a product online was extremely valuable.</description>

      <description>Background Nextt was a collaborative social planning tool. Nextt&amp;rsquo;s goal was to make it easier to plan social events for 4-10 people within the next 14 days, and the service did so by allowing users to create and share event Ideas that, once the date/time, location, and attendees were finalized, transitioned into a Plan. If the Idea did not reach fruition within a preset amount of time, it would self-destruct, forcing the user to take action.</description>
