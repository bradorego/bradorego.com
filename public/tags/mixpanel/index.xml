      <description>Background Nextt was a collaborative social planning tool. Nextt&amp;rsquo;s goal was to make it easier to plan social events for 4-10 people within the next 14 days, and the service did so by allowing users to create and share event Ideas that, once the date/time, location, and attendees were finalized, transitioned into a Plan. If the Idea did not reach fruition within a preset amount of time, it would self-destruct, forcing the user to take action.</description>
