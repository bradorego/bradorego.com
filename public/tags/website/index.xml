&lt;h1 id=&#34;about:58aa00a3f9ec4cc7a62166ecd695ef26&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zebradog is an environmental graphic design firm located in Madison, WI who specializes in creating immersive, branded experiences for their clients. Zebradog&amp;rsquo;s multidisciplinary team of architects, graphic designers, and software developers blend the physical and digital realms, creating novel digital applications of technology for interactive multimedia and website design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with Zebradog gave me the opportunity to work with an extremely talented team as well as push the limits of  web technology in the interactive multimedia space. During my time at Zebradog, we made the decision to move away from the technology the company had previously used (Quartz Composer) and toward embracing the developing world of web technology, which lead us to experiment with a lot of new technology, such as Three.js (for WebGL), Zigfu (for Kinect), and many Javascript touch libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other branch of Zebradog&amp;rsquo;s Digital Team built beautiful, well-structured, and  highly usable websites for clients. Built mainly on Drupal, ZD&amp;rsquo;s sites traditionally had not been responsive or mobile-friendly, which is another point I stressed while working with ZD. Mid-State Technical College serves as an example of the first mobile-first design project Zebradog completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about:7d17b5de2bae6f85a1bc96bad5421a8e&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Studio Etc. (&amp;ldquo;etc&amp;rdquo;) is an architectural design firm headquarted in Madison, WI with over 30 years of design and consulting experience. etc&amp;rsquo;s work is featured all over Madison, greater Wisconsin, and even other areas of the country such as Illinois, Arizona, and California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc&amp;rsquo;s former website was a flat set of three pages which left the user with virtually no idea of what the company actually was/did. The &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page was the only way to glean any real information, and the design was dominated by an image that had very little value-add. Within a course of a couple weeks, the entire brand identity, look and feel, and design of the website was turned around (with the help and incredible energy of the client).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new website features responsive design, a fluid layout, image slideshows (with lightbox for greater detail), and three structured subsections of the website (about, &amp;ldquo;what we do&amp;rdquo; (aka projects), and &amp;ldquo;on the boards&amp;rdquo; (aka blog)). The new look aligns with etc&amp;rsquo;s new identity, and provides a modern website to carry the company forward while making edits and updates easy via Drupal&amp;rsquo;s admin interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about:9cc2c373eb610eea06efd486da1e5d1a&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;inspire&lt;/em&gt;DANCE Festival is the result of Arielle Friedlander&amp;rsquo;s 2010 KEY Project at the University of Rochester. As an ogoing festival, &lt;em&gt;inspire&lt;/em&gt;DANCE&amp;rsquo;s goals are to strengthen the dance community in Rochester by connecting students to professional dancers in and around the Rochester area. The Festival features professional dancers and instructors from Rochester as well as a feature artist with national (and sometimes world) renown. Past artists include &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.billevansdance.org/&#34;&gt;Bill Evans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chosendance.com/&#34;&gt;Clyde Evans, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heidilatskydance.net/heidilatskydance/&#34;&gt;Heidi Latsky&lt;/a&gt;, and Illstyle &amp;amp; Peace Productions as well as all of the artists on faculty at the University of Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the founding members, my role in &lt;em&gt;inspire&lt;/em&gt;DANCE&amp;rsquo;s formation was both the Fundraising &amp;amp; Publicity Director and the Assistant to the Director. I was responsible for reaching out to different groups around campus as well as in the Rochetser community to secure funding for the event as well as to publicize the festival, including development of print and web media. As Assitant to the Director, I carried out many administrative tasks and assisted in decision making on issues large and small, including marketing, financing, and other administrative decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;inspire&lt;/em&gt;DANCE website was built at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice as a temporary location for information about the event before and during the festival. Site design was based on the flyers for the event.&lt;/p&gt;
