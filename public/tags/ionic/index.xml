      <description>About Therma-Stor is a high-end dehumidifier, water heater, and disaster recovery/restoration manufacturer established in 1977.

With that move they were also interested in bringing their products online to offer internet-enabled options.
With so many examples of IoT products gone wrong, and all the ways one can go wrong, the opportunity to get in on the ground level of taking a product online was extremely valuable.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Ionic lets you build apps ridiculously fast. Write once, build many. If you don&#39;t like how something&#39;s done, instead of just complaining about it, do something to make it better. Reverse engineering is easier than ever. Your success is not a factor of your codebase, but about the value you offer an end-user. The end result: Better MCBW   Backstory  Madison Craft Beer Week has been one of my favorite events since moving to Madison.</description>
