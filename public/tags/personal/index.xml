      <title>New Site!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It only took me about 10 months, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to rebuilding this site to have a purpose. I originally built a personal website when I was leaving Epic with the intention of having a place to show my past work as well as a place to play around with new technologies on the web. That was, at least, the intention. If any of you were keeping tabs on it, that never actually happened. I built the site haphazardly over the course of a few days and never updated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, though, it&amp;rsquo;ll be different. Two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I built the site on top of Drupal this time around instead of doing everything by hand. This means I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to be a whizkid web developer anymore (read: more professional) and it also means updating things is a lot easier/less painful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a reason and method of keeping it up to date. If I&amp;rsquo;m blogging about usability/user experience, it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse to keep on top of things, and to keep it fresh. Plus, if I want to be a consultant, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta show my stuff somehow, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to give a fair bit of credit to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://zebradog.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ZD&lt;/a&gt; family for both inspiring me and giving me some experience building sites from scratch on top of Drupal. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where I am today (both in terms of skills and motivation) if not for them, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to each new day with ZD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas of blog post themes/threads (Design in the Wild, War Stories, etc.), but this blog will also likely be a mixture of professional, personal, and possibly-insane. It&amp;rsquo;ll be fun to work on it, see it grow, populate my portfolio, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onward and upward.&lt;/p&gt;
