      <description>About Therma-Stor is a high-end dehumidifier, water heater, and disaster recovery/restoration manufacturer established in 1977. Most of their products are focused on commercial applications, but recently theyâ€™ve been expanding into the high-end residential space with some of their units. With that move they were also interested in bringing their products online to offer internet-enabled options.
With so many examples of IoT products gone wrong, and all the ways one can go wrong, the opportunity to get in on the ground level of taking a product online was extremely valuable.</description>
