      <description>TL;DNR  In the early days of software, having a product that worked was good enough. Nowadays design is the differentiator. There are multiple factors to a good design: learnability, efficiency, flexibility, aesthetics. The study of human-centered design isn&#39;t new. The same concepts that Jakob Nielsen covered in the 1980s ring true today.   In 2015, I was interviewed for the Rochester Review, my alma mater&amp;rsquo;s quarterly publication for parents and alumni.</description>

      <title>Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts of Corporate Innovation</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  There&#39;s a ton of potential in the corporate innovation world, and as the venture market cools, the future of early stage might be corporate. Innovation teams need certain special rules and freedoms compared to the core business, especially in highly regulated industries. Culture and environment are the most important things to define and develop in these settings. Don&#39;t settle, and don&#39;t let corporate culture interfere.   As some of you may know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time working in the corporate innovation team of a Fortune 500 company.</description>

      <title>Why We&#39;re Firing a Top-Tier Product Development Firm</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Culture trumps credentials, reputation, and pretty much everything else. Don&#39;t be afraid to pull the plug on something if it isn&#39;t working. Trust your gut and stick to your guns. If you want something done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Just because it has a corporate name tag doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t talented people.   Some of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing recently has been with what&amp;rsquo;s known as the Business Development branch of a large company.</description>

      <title>The Dangers of Tight Iteration</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/</link>

      <description>TL;DNR  Getting a lot of feedback quickly isn&#39;t necessarily always the best strategy - having a guiding light is helpful as well. Users react to the level of fidelity of what you show them. You might be missing something if your fidelity doesn&#39;t match the issue in the design. Good Product Design (or at least, a good discovery phase/project plan) can alleviate these issues.   Before starting a new engagement with a client, I always ask a series of questions about their company, their processes, and the project I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on.</description>

      <title>Product vs Project Management</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/</link>

      <description>TL;DNR  There&#39;s still a fair amount of confusion between product management and project management. Lots of people do the latter well, but the former is often forgotten/forgone. Project Management is focused on execution - securing and organizing resources, planning out tasks, and keeping things on track. Velocity. How. When. Product Management is more about vision - understanding what your users are trying to achieve, having a sense of the big picture, and making sure what&#39;s being created fits expectations and needs.</description>
