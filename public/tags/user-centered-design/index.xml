&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;tldnr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;TL;DNR&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Getting a lot of feedback quickly isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always the best strategy - having a guiding light is helpful as well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Users react to the level of fidelity of what you show them. You might be missing something if your fidelity doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the issue in the design.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Good Product Design (or at least, a good discovery phase/project plan) can alleviate these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting a new engagement with a client, I always ask a series of questions about their company, their processes, and the project I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on. One of those questions asks how they&amp;rsquo;re currently handling user research and product design and I&amp;rsquo;m often told they &amp;ldquo;have a tight feedback loop&amp;rdquo; and that&amp;rsquo;s all they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot wrong with this answer, but let&amp;rsquo;s unpack it a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rapid-prototyping-a-name-rapidprototyping-href-rapidprototyping-i-class-ion-link-i-a:bed2c57243224eaf92c5dc8e3d145ddb&#34;&gt;Rapid Prototyping &lt;a name=&#34;rapidPrototyping&#34; href=&#34;#rapidPrototyping&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;ion-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, effective use of Rapid Prototyping can be immensely beneficial to a product. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I could convince every company in the world to do, it would be to use some type of rapid prototyping in their product design. If I got a fraction of all of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://time.com/13549/the-10-worst-product-fails-of-all-time/&#34;&gt;money spent&lt;/a&gt; building products that ultimately failed, I&amp;rsquo;d never have to work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Rapid Prototyping is more a process or practice than a technique or specific tools. Rapid Prototyping involves getting as much feedback as often as possible throughout the design process, and this is accomplished by varying the level of fidelity of what you&amp;rsquo;re testing (more on this later). By exposing the current version of your product in all of its incomplete glory, you save sinking time into things that don&amp;rsquo;t work, and ultimately build a better product for your target user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the variety of options when it comes to Rapid Prototyping elsewhere, but here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of some of the options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper Prototypes - hand-drawn sketches of what an interface might look like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wizard of Oz - the practice of playing the role of the computer by abstracting future functionality away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing Your Competitor - before building your solution, see what problems users have with existing solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive Prototypes - semi-functional software systems users can interact with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;let-s-talk-about-fidelity-a-name-fidelity-href-fidelity-i-class-ion-link-i-a:bed2c57243224eaf92c5dc8e3d145ddb&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk About Fidelity &lt;a name=&#34;fidelity&#34; href=&#34;#fidelity&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;ion-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact definition of fidelity isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly clear, but it roughly refers to the level of detail your current iteration includes. It&amp;rsquo;s often used in the context of prototyping, but it can refer to existing products as well. Your typical startup MVP is a high-fidelity prototype but a low-fidelity product. Fidelity exists on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/#the-prototyping-spectrum&#34;&gt;continuum&lt;/a&gt;, with the lower end including concepts, sketches, and rough wireframes, and the higher end being branded/visually design and interactive prototypes. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen far too many products that jump right into the deep end of fidelity, missing out on all of the potential learning from testing lower fidelity prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://bradorego.com/img/posts/dangers-of-tight-iteration/graph.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/sketches-and-wireframes-and-prototypes-oh-my-creating-your-own-magical-wizard-experience.php&#34;&gt;Credit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be somewhat contradictory to recommend using a lower level of detail, but you have to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blinkux.com/blog/choosing-the-right-level-of-fidelity-for-your-wireframes/&#34;&gt;match your level of fidelity&lt;/a&gt; to the type of feedback you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. Your users will respond to the fidelity they&amp;rsquo;re given, and their feedback will be colored by this. If you give them paper, they&amp;rsquo;ll talk about things like workflow, high-level design, and desired features. If you give them highly designed (read: Sketch/Photoshop) images, they&amp;rsquo;ll talk about things like color scheme, fonts, and whitespace. If you give them an interactive prototype, they&amp;rsquo;ll talk about things like transitions, interactivity, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph (and more great coverage of the pluses and minuses of different levels of fidelity) from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/sketches-and-wireframes-and-prototypes-oh-my-creating-your-own-magical-wizard-experience.php&#34;&gt;UX Matters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-it-matters-a-name-why-href-why-i-class-ion-link-i-a:bed2c57243224eaf92c5dc8e3d145ddb&#34;&gt;Why It Matters &lt;a name=&#34;why&#34; href=&#34;#why&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;ion-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be intoxicating to set a baseline and watch your numbers improve on whatever metrics you&amp;rsquo;ve set, as you iterate. Arguably, data-informed design is a good thing, especially compared to the alternative. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/data-informed-not-data-driven-the-subtext/&#34;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; is when data starts driving your decisions, and you lose sight of the big picture - improving the experience for the end user. Increased conversions, decreased errors, or more efficient interactions may not necessarily be the most enjoyable experience (e.g. a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.hbs.edu/rbuell/papers/buell_norton_2011.pdf&#34;&gt;wait time&lt;/a&gt; might actually be a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this approach is it might be honing in on what&amp;rsquo;s known as a local maxima. Naive &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing&#34;&gt;hill-climbing&lt;/a&gt; algorithms can fall victim to this problem as well. Essentially, you continue to see improvements and make changes until you reach a point where those improvements either diminish entirely or degrade. At this point, traditional wisdom would be to stop working and either a) work on something else, or b) declare yourself victorious and toast your achievement, all the while missing what could be a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://bradorego.com/img/posts/dangers-of-tight-iteration/local-maxima.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2011/01/06/local-maxima-and-the-perils-of-data-driven-design/&#34;&gt;Credit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a philosophical note, I like to think of every design problem (if not every problem in life) as something like the above graphic, except the plane is infinite &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;re always other options, some of which might be better than our current situation if we&amp;rsquo;re just willing to take the leap of faith and try a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;fighting-the-local-maxima-a-name-local-href-local-i-class-ion-link-i-a:bed2c57243224eaf92c5dc8e3d145ddb&#34;&gt;Fighting the Local Maxima &lt;a name=&#34;local&#34; href=&#34;#local&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;ion-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we&amp;rsquo;re aware of the problem and what causes it. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily tell us what to do about it, though. Here&amp;rsquo;s a great strategy outlined in an article from 2010:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  One strategy we might employ is to optimize until we reach a point of diminishing returns: design until changes just aren’t having a big effect. Then, stop optimizing and return to other kinds of analysis to figure out the next steps. Conduct interviews. Do user testing. Give surveys, ask questions. Find out the biggest existing pain points instead of focusing on tiny design elements at this stage. Focus at the activity-level. What are people trying to accomplish? What are their higher-level goals? What aren’t people doing that we want them to? What big hurdles keep them from taking the next action? This level of insight will allow you to make those bigger changes.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo;ve said it better myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-brief-plug:bed2c57243224eaf92c5dc8e3d145ddb&#34;&gt;A brief plug&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you find yourself reading this post and thinking &amp;ldquo;our products have definitely suffered from the wrong type of feedback&amp;rdquo;? Part of the reason this has come up a lot for me is I&amp;rsquo;m looking into a product-manager-as-a-service model. You should &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:bradley.orego@gmail.com&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;d like to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;tldnr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;TL;DNR&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s still a fair amount of confusion between product management and project management. Lots of people do the latter well, but the former is often forgotten/forgone.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Project Management is focused on execution - securing and organizing resources, planning out tasks, and keeping things on track. Velocity. How. When.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Product Management is more about vision - understanding what your users are trying to achieve, having a sense of the big picture, and making sure what&amp;rsquo;s being created fits expectations and needs. Trajectory. What. Why.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brainmates.com.au/brainrants/project-manager-vs-product-manager&#34;&gt;hardly&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://koombea.com/blog/the-difference-between-product-and-project-management/&#34;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/building-the-right-thing-vs-building-the-thing-right.html&#34;&gt;person&lt;/a&gt; to write about this (though &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastcodesign.com/3055429/how-to-avoid-making-products-no-one-wants&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; is particularly relevant/pointed), but it&amp;rsquo;s been coming up a lot for me lately as I think about what I want to do next, work-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come up time and time again is the need for a Product Manager. It seems that most companies have a great sense of how to execute, and they&amp;rsquo;re great at the work that they do, but figuring out what they should be doing can be a struggle. This shows up for consulting firms in the form of rework and for product firms in the form of failed product launches. I will always cringe when I think about how much time and money is wasted creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/kirstenking/products-literally-no-one-asked-for?utm_term=.glwJ8aEdE#.cf5ekOv5v&#34;&gt;things people don&amp;rsquo;t want&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about some of these differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-management-a-name-project-href-project-i-class-ion-link-i-a:2bc9b53639a6b650caacc5bab7e9a353&#34;&gt;Project Management &lt;a name=&#34;proJect&#34; href=&#34;#proJect&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;ion-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project&lt;/em&gt; - a (often temporary) endeavor undertaken in order to complete a task, achieve a goal, or create a product or service. Casually, a project is just a thing a person or group does to accomplish something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Manager&lt;/em&gt; - the individual responsible for coordinating resources, tasks, and schedule in order to ensure the project is successful. This often includes things like getting stakeholder buy in, securing a budget and/or time, assembling the right team of individuals, picking a methodology (whether agile, waterfall, or anything else), creating a backlog, planning tasks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful Project Managers are good at getting the right people involved and following up with them to make sure they have everything they need to fulfill their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Questions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who do you need for this project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When will the project be delivered?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the current project velocity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we get in scope given the budget and/or timeline restrictions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what order will features be implemented?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;product-management-a-name-product-href-product-i-class-ion-link-i-a:2bc9b53639a6b650caacc5bab7e9a353&#34;&gt;Product Management &lt;a name=&#34;proDuct&#34; href=&#34;#proDuct&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;ion-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product&lt;/em&gt; - a good, service, or tool built in order to solve a problem for a user (or, ideally, users). Casually, a product is something people use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product Manager&lt;/em&gt; - the individual responsible for figuring out what the thing is supposed to do and how it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do that. This may include determining feasibility from a business/financial standpoint, conducting any market and/or user research required to gain insights into who the end user is and what their needs are, defining a set of features to satisfy user needs, creating low-fidelity prototypes in order to communicate feature sets and behaviors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful Product Managers are good at knowing what role their product serves and for whom, and ideally can align business goals with the needs of the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Questions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is the target user? The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=ux+personas&#34;&gt;more specific, the better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is the customer? (this is sometimes different than the user)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are their needs? Wants? Fears?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this product solve user needs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the benefit to the end user, especially compared to their current solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;separate-but-equal-a-name-separate-href-separate-i-class-ion-link-i-a:2bc9b53639a6b650caacc5bab7e9a353&#34;&gt;Separate, but equal? &lt;a name=&#34;separate&#34; href=&#34;#separate&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;ion-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve defined some of the differences between the two PMs, we can better understand the role each fills, what their concerns are, and why they&amp;rsquo;re important to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Managers are going to be talking to a lot of different stakeholders early on in the lifecycle and making sure it makes sense to move forward with a project. Product Managers are going to be doing a lot of the discovery phase of a project, and then stay involved throughout the implementation to make sure what&amp;rsquo;s being built matches the idea (as well as, ideally, running users through interim usability studies to catch any issues that were hard to predict before having an artifact to interact with).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Managers are going to be more involved in the day-to-day of a buildout, having little interaction with the product before that step of the process (sure, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to have a PJM involved through the process in order to have background knowledge but also keep track of resources through the entire lifecycle, but in my experience that&amp;rsquo;s the abnormal case). Project Managers will be focusing on managing expectations of the stakeholders, interfacing with the Product Manager, and securing whatever resources are needed. The Project Manager is also going to be working with the implementation team, making sure they&amp;rsquo;re on task and working well interpersonally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;
http://allaboutproductmanagement.blogspot.com/2007/03/project-manager-or-product-manager.html&#34;&gt;classic analogy&lt;/a&gt; is the project manager as a midwife, whereas the product manager is the mother. Project will come in to deliver the baby, but all of the preparation before and all of the care afterwards is up to Product. I like to think of it more like an architect versus a foreman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the planning, research, and vision is the architect&amp;rsquo;s responsibility, and once the building is done, they&amp;rsquo;re the ones who everyone will look to when the building is successful or not (obviously there&amp;rsquo;s some back and forth with engineering as well in terms of feasibility&amp;hellip;another parallel in software). The foreman is responsible for making sure his team can execute and do what&amp;rsquo;s been planned out, but they&amp;rsquo;re often the unsung heroes of a successful project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you find yourself reading this post and thinking &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ve got the project part down, but shoot, having a product person would be great&amp;rdquo;? Part of the reason this has come up a lot for me is I&amp;rsquo;m looking into a product-manager-as-a-service model.
