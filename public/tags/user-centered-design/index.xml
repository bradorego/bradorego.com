      <description>TL;DNR  Culture trumps credentials, reputation, and pretty much everything else. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to pull the plug on something if it isn&amp;rsquo;t working. Trust your gut and stick to your guns. If you want something done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Just because it has a corporate name tag doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there aren&amp;rsquo;t talented people.   
Some of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing recently has been with what&amp;rsquo;s known as the Business Development branch of a large company.</description>

      <title>The Dangers of Tight Iteration</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Getting a lot of feedback quickly isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always the best strategy - having a guiding light is helpful as well. Users react to the level of fidelity of what you show them. You might be missing something if your fidelity doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the issue in the design. Good Product Design (or at least, a good discovery phase/project plan) can alleviate these issues.   
Before starting a new engagement with a client, I always ask a series of questions about their company, their processes, and the project I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on.</description>

      <title>Product vs Project Management</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/</link>

      <description>TL;DNR  There&amp;rsquo;s still a fair amount of confusion between product management and project management. Lots of people do the latter well, but the former is often forgotten/forgone. Project Management is focused on execution - securing and organizing resources, planning out tasks, and keeping things on track. Velocity. How. When. Product Management is more about vision - understanding what your users are trying to achieve, having a sense of the big picture, and making sure what&amp;rsquo;s being created fits expectations and needs.</description>
