      <description>TL;DNR  In the early days of software, having a product that worked was good enough. Nowadays design is the differentiator. There are multiple factors to a good design: learnability, efficiency, flexibility, aesthetics. The study of human-centered design isn&#39;t new. The same concepts that Jakob Nielsen covered in the 1980s ring true today.   In 2015, I was interviewed for the Rochester Review, my alma mater&amp;rsquo;s quarterly publication for parents and alumni.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Ionic lets you build apps ridiculously fast. Write once, build many. If you don&#39;t like how something&#39;s done, instead of just complaining about it, do something to make it better. Reverse engineering is easier than ever.

The end result: Better MCBW   Backstory  Madison Craft Beer Week has been one of my favorite events since moving to Madison.</description>

      <description>Lessons Learned  Never underestimate the value of guerrilla UX research. Instead of spending hours debating something internally, put together a survey and put it on Reddit. Use the resources and data available to you. Utilizing a well-defined analytics suite to define funnels and focus on problem points and in-depth user research to discover why people are falling off at that point can have tremendous impacts on conversion/success rates. Mark&#39;s postmortem covers a lot of what we learned and expresses similar sentiments to what I had as we closed down Nextt.</description>
