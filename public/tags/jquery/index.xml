      <description>About Design Studio Etc. (&amp;ldquo;etc&amp;rdquo;) is an architectural design firm headquarted in Madison, WI with over 30 years of design and consulting experience. etc&amp;rsquo;s work is featured all over Madison, greater Wisconsin, and even other areas of the country such as Illinois, Arizona, and California.
etc&amp;rsquo;s former website was a flat set of three pages which left the user with virtually no idea of what the company actually was/did. The &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page was the only way to glean any real information, and the design was dominated by an image that had very little value-add.</description>
