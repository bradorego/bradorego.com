      <description>TL;DNR  Pop-ups are distracting. Design your life to have less sudden distractions and you&#39;ll be more productive and happier. Desiging user experiences that encourage flow are good.   I&amp;rsquo;ve become more and more interested in Flow recently. As a psych major, flow is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of for a long time, but I always thought of it as something that just happens, and never gave it much thought.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Memory is fallible, and humans tend to remember the most intense part and the ending of any experience. Finding systems that work for you is essential to productivity. Limit the number of choices a user has to (or has the opportunity to) make. Choose smart defaults and hide most options.   I have a habit when it comes to books. When I read a book, I almost always underline/take notes in the margin.</description>
