      <description>TL;DNR  Static generators (e.g. Hugo) are pretty cool. Ease of use/production directly relates to content creation. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to borrow aesthetics/technologies/designs from others.   
As you might be able to tell, my last blog post is from 2014. It was about time to get back on the blog horse but also give the site a little facelift. I&amp;rsquo;d migrated blog platforms in the past, but never really took the time to think about how my own personal site was hosted.</description>

      <description>About Design Studio Etc. (&amp;ldquo;etc&amp;rdquo;) is an architectural design firm headquarted in Madison, WI with over 30 years of design and consulting experience. etc&amp;rsquo;s work is featured all over Madison, greater Wisconsin, and even other areas of the country such as Illinois, Arizona, and California.
etc&amp;rsquo;s former website was a flat set of three pages which left the user with virtually no idea of what the company actually was/did. The &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page was the only way to glean any real information, and the design was dominated by an image that had very little value-add.</description>
