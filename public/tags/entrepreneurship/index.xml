      <description>About Trinker is a service that simplifies your social life by providing an easy, secure way to share your nightlife activities, keep track of your drinking buddies, see what parts of town are hoppin&amp;rsquo;, and even save you some cash. Trinker represents my first foray into entrepreneurship, and has been a constant source of inspiration, energy, and learning for me.
Trinker was first brought to life through conversations with Rob Brooks, a good friend of mine, and when we decided to participate in Startup Weekend: Madison 2012.</description>
