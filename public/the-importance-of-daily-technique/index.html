Aside from the physical exercise (which is an important element for performing artists), all of this time spent doing roughly the same thing has many benefits and side-effects. But <strong>in the world of product design, do we have an analog?</strong></p><h1 id=first-things-first-who-needs-technique-a-name-who-needs-href-who-needs-i-class-ion-link-i-a>First things first: who needs technique? <a name=who-needs href=#who-needs><i class=ion-link></i></a></h1><blockquote><p>“I’m an amazing designer. I don’t need to repeat some silly beginner’s exercises.” — Some arrogant designer (definitely not you, though)</p></blockquote><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re the principal dancer or if it’s your first day on the job, everyone does the same exercises and takes the same classes. Of course there’s room for more advanced versions of certain exercises (just as there are remedial versions for beginners), but by and large, everyone’s doing the same thing. What this does (on top of aligning your company and teaching them how to move together) is <strong>gives each dancer the opportunity to focus on different aspects</strong> of the exercise.</p><p>This is another one of the fringe benefits of doing the same sets of exercises day in and day out. I can’t tell you how many <a href="http://www.abt.org/explore/learn/explore-learn-ballet-dictionary/">pliés, tendus</a>, <a href=https://www.contemporary-dance.org/graham-floor-work.html>deep stretches, or turns-around-the-back</a> I’ve done in my life, but having that level of repetition and familiarity means I can focus on things like what’s <em>happening in the rest of my body</em> (am I sitting into the opposite hip? am I displacing my ribs? am I activating from underneath? did I lose my turn-out? where’s my gaze/focus? etc.) on or the <em>dynamics of the music</em> (are we on 1 or on the and? should this be sharp/aggressive or more fluid? how do I sustain this movement until the next beat? is the accent in or out? am I using all of the counts) or on the *movement quality <em>(where does this movement initiate? is this more of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_movement_analysis>a punch or a glide</a>? how do I connect these two phrases?)</em>.* One of the things we’ve been working on a lot in my Sokolow classes is phrasing; how you put movement together to create a coherent, standalone unit (much like the way you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=phrase">group words together</a>). <strong>When’s the last time you thought about what a phrase looks like in the design context?</strong></p><figure><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*DLMGW4Gonr9LdhcJeK0b2A.jpeg></figure><p>So, regardless of how accomplished, how senior, or how expert you may be, this type of repetitive, daily technique work is crucial to your work.</p><p>The other main benefit to this repetitive technique work is it gives you something to fall back on. Performing as a novice means you have to constantly attend to everything technique-wise on top of trying to remember choreography. Advanced artists can rely on their technique, freeing them up to <strong>focus on the task at hand</strong> (e.g. performance quality, reading the audience, choreographic specifics, being present). They know they’ve spent the time to invest in their instrument and in their technique, and they have time set aside to do so. They aren’t thinking about where their shoulder is on stage; they’re fully engaged in the act of performing. Imagine that: not having to worry about your technique so you can be fully engaged in your work.</p><h1 id=okay-i-m-convinced-help-me-understand-what-this-looks-like-for-dance-a-name-convinced-href-convinced-i-class-ion-link-i-a>Okay, I’m convinced. Help me understand what this looks like for dance? <a name=convinced href=#convinced><i class=ion-link></i></a></h1><p>There will be variations in each style (which is why dancers are usually recommend to train several but focus on one; as McKinsey would call it, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyboynton/2011/10/18/are-you-an-i-or-a-t/">T-shaped</a>), but pretty much any technique has a <strong>series of exercises that build upon each other and are performed in roughly the same order</strong> in every class. Not every single exercise is required, but there are some staples that you’ll see all the time (e.g. there’s always going to be plies but you might not always get battement frappé). Exercises have many variants that the teacher can employ to fit the level of the class they’re teaching and/or to emphasize certain elements/aspects. <strong>Ideally, you can go through a class by yourself</strong>, though you certainly won’t gain the full benefit of being with others/being instructed.</p><p><strong>Each technique has its own philosophy and set of core values, and this is what helps define one from the other</strong>. Some of the actual physical movements/exercises may be the same between two techniques (or, more likely, look the same but have a different effort/intention), but the over-arching philosophy is the important part. In <a href="http://www.marthagraham.org/">Graham</a>, that includes spinal rotation, the shift of weight onto a straight leg, and the contraction/release. In <a href="http://sokolowtheatredance.org/">Sokolow</a>, it’s a neutral, lifted sternum, the sensation of reaching out/down through the limbs, and the subtraction of any affect/indulgence in movement. <strong>Knowing how and when to employ which way of moving is crucial to a dancer</strong>, and that’s not even talking about aesthetic/artistic intention.</p><h1 id=what-does-this-look-like-for-design-a-name-for-design-href-for-design-i-class-ion-link-i-a>What does this look like for design? <a name=for-design href=#for-design><i class=ion-link></i></a></h1><p>For myself (and a majority of my peers), technique work is almost completely absent from everyday/professional life. <strong>Technique is something you either did in school and haven’t touched since, or maybe you go to workshops/conferences once a year to brush up on or learn something new.</strong> Sometimes, rarely, it’s something you do in your spare time because you’ve found something fascinating and new. At work, we’re usually expected to produce all day every day instead of having time dedicated to the craft. Even trying to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ux+design+exercises">Google for “UX Design Exercises”</a> gets you a mixed bag of results, mostly pointing to interviews. If the only time you’re practicing your technique is in an interview, that’s probably a bad sign.</p><figure><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*H0tkGQxpkYZnvFIAORnWDQ.jpeg></figure><p>The world of design is wide and varied, so these exercises can take a variety of forms. A good place to start might be the <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methods/">exercises used in design sprints</a>, as they’re usually designed to shake people out of their typical way of thinking or generate a lot of creativity quickly. UserTesting <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/09/24/3-exercises-to-sharpen-your-ux-skills/">published a few exercises</a> that, with a few tweaks, could be reusable. Improvisational Theater is another great place to look, as there’s a <a href="http://improvencyclopedia.org/games/">wide variety of games</a> that could be adapted to a design setting.</p><p>On top of the strategic side of design, there are also the practicals of working within a medium. Many of us learned these in school (or early in our careers) and simply don’t go back and practice them again. If you’re an industrial designer, spend a few minutes playing with a new material (plastic vs. wood vs. metal). If you’re a graphic designer, choose a typeface or color palette you’re not used to (complementary vs. triad vs. analogous). If you’re an interaction designer, work at a level of fidelity you aren’t used to (always use Sketch? Try with Sharpie + Paper).</p><figure><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*w76E-2onoJTIwHHwJVc6ig.jpeg><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/blur-close-up-hands-marker-411086/">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>I’d be hard-pressed to prescribe a set of daily or weekly exercises everyone should do; pick what works best for you and for your team. What I would implore, though, is to work this into a daily routine (weekly if you really can’t spare 5–15 minutes a day). Taking time away from the day to day to either work on something different or give your current work a different approach will not only “sharpen the axe” and broaden your tool set but also give you fresh perspective.</p><p><em>Originally posted on <a href=http://performing.design>performing.design</a></em></p><hr><p class=post-meta>Posted on May 26, 2018 in <a href=/categories/user-experience target=_self>User Experience</a><br>Tags: <a href=/tags/user-centered-design target=_self>[user-centered design]</a> <a href=/tags/technique target=_self>[technique]</a> <a href=/tags/performing-design target=_self>[performing design]</a> <a href=/tags/dance target=_self>[dance]</a> <a href=/tags/design-thinking target=_self>[design thinking]</a> <a href=/tags/practice target=_self>[practice]</a></p><hr>All <b>User Experience</b> posts:<ul class=categories><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/building-a-ux-department-from-scratch-at-a-20-year-old-big-data-company/" target=_self>Building a UX Department from scratch at a 20-year-old Big Data Company</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/a-designers-guide-to-gdpr/" target=_self>A Designer&#39;s Guide to GDPR</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/improvisation-creativity-and-design/" target=_self>Improvisation, Creativity, and Design</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/the-importance-of-daily-technique/" target=_self>The Importance of (Daily) Technique</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/an-intro-to-embodied-cognition/" target=_self>An Intro to Embodied Cognition</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/usability-research-checklist/" target=_self>Usability Research Checklist</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/ux-considerations-for-iot/" target=_self>UX Considerations For IoT</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/" target=_self>The Dangers of Tight Iteration</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/" target=_self>Product vs Project Management</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/transparency-of-online/" target=_self>Transparency of &#34;Online&#34;</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/an-open-letter-to-okcupid/" target=_self>An Open Letter to OkCupid</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/the-importance-of-flow/" target=_self>The Importance of Flow</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/note-taking/" target=_self>Note-taking</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/the-importance-of-content/" target=_self>The Importance of Content</a></li><li><a href="http://bradorego.com/ditw-stovetop/" target=_self>DITW: Stovetop</a></li></ul></div></div><footer><div class=container><hr class="medium dark"><ul class="list-inline text-center"><li class=list-inline-item><a href=mailto:hello@bradorego.com><i class="ion-android-mail ion-32"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://twitter.com/bradorego><i class="ion-social-twitter ion-32"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://github.com/bradorego><i class="ion-social-github ion-32"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://instagram.com/bradorego><i class="ion-social-instagram ion-32"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/bradorego><i class="ion-social-linkedin ion-32"></i></a></li><li class="patreon list-inline-item"><a href=https://www.patreon.com/bradorego><svg version=1.0 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg width=24pt height=18pt viewbox="0 0 160 166"><g transform="translate(0,160) scale(0.1,-0.1)" fill=#404040 stroke=none><path d="M0 800 l0 -800 145 0 145 0 0 800 0 800 -145 0 -145 0 0 -800z"></path><path d="M911 1580 c-204 -54 -374 -225 -427 -431 -22 -84 -22 -227 1 -304 48 -168 167 -312 317 -384 105 -50 182 -65 301 -58 116 7 198 35 296 101 165 113 261 294 261 491 -1 398 -367 685 -749 585z"></path></g></svg></a></li></ul><div class=text-center><a href=http://rochestermade.com title="Rochester Made"><img alt="Rochester Made" id=rochesterMade src=https://rochestermade.com/media/images/rochester-made-dark-on-light.png title="Rochester Made"></a></div></div></footer><script src=/js/all.js></script></body></html>
