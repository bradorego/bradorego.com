<p>I have a habit when it comes to books. When I read a book, I almost always underline/take notes in the margin. I started doing so sometime in high school, when Literature teachers started telling us it was okay to write in books. The practice carried me through my studies, and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it so much it&rsquo;s spilled over into my personal/leisure reading (mind you, all of my leisure reading is non-fiction). You can actually tell which books in my personal collection were books I really enjoyed/valued based on how heavily marked up they are.</p>

<p>Since graduating from college, I&rsquo;ve started a new version of the practice. Now, after finishing a book (sometimes immediately, but usually after a little time), I go back through the book and look over all of the underlining and notes I took. Generally speaking, when I underline something, it&rsquo;s because it had a certian salience or value to me at the time. So, as I recount these notes, I take a mini post-it note and write whatever value I was trying to glean from it, and then I stick it to the margin of that page. The results look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/notetaking/paradox5.jpg" /></p>

<p>Not only does this practice reinforce what I&rsquo;ve learned from that book, but it also changes the way I&rsquo;ve experienced reading that book. In Barry Schwartz&rsquo;s book &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005696">The Paradox of Choice</a>&rdquo;, he cites <a href="http://profron.net/happiness/files/readings/Kahneman_ObjectiveHappiness.pdf">a study by Daniel Kahneman</a>&nbsp;which recounts the way we experience and remember the utility of something (that is, how much we enjoyed it).</p>

<p>What Kahneman et al. found is that our remembered utility is governed by two main factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Our experience of the peak (or most intense) portion (good/bad)</li>
<li>Our experience of the ending (good/bad)</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can imagine, this has an interesting implication for all parts of life, but particularly, for the design of user interfaces and user experiences.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I&rsquo;ve heard people (users) explain their experience with a particular piece of technology. While I don&rsquo;t recall hearing much about the ending (maybe I just don&rsquo;t pay attention), it seems that many users are &ldquo;sold&rdquo; on one particular instance where either a) the system did something cool/fun/awesome (e.g. MailChimp&rsquo;s Freddie the monkey&rsquo;s awesome quotes) or b) the product was particularly handy/useful in a given situation.</p>

<p>The minor details of the interface, animations, colors, typography, etc. that designers and marketing teams undoubtedly spent hours laboring over have almost no value to users. I&rsquo;m sure they add to the positive experience, and &ldquo;grease the slicks&rdquo; between the user and their end goal, but when we really get down and think about what it is we&rsquo;re designing for, the minor details that can hold projects up (should) melt away. Your perfectly-aligned-and-proportioned interface elements won&rsquo;t matter at all if the user can&rsquo;t do what they want/need to do with your product.</p>

<p>Schwartz also discusses an incredible array of information and concepts that I believe everyone should be aware of, such as opportunity costs, satisficing vs. maximizing, and the role of utility (esp. diminishing utility) in our daily lives. I&rsquo;d highly recommend giving it a read, as I&rsquo;ve personally seen benefit in my life by putting some of his suggestions into play.</p>
