      <description>About The Ionic Framework was first released in October 2013 and has since taken the hybrid app development world by storm, recently announcing their Series A. I built my first full-fledged Ionic app in earnest almost a year after the platform was announced. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with companies to build dozens of Ionic apps for everything from pure prototypes to production-level applications.
In particular, here&amp;rsquo;s a short list of Ionic apps I&amp;rsquo;ve built for my own purposes.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Ionic lets you build apps ridiculously fast. Write once, build many. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like how something&amp;rsquo;s done, instead of just complaining about it, do something to make it better. Reverse engineering is easier than ever. Your success is not a factor of your codebase, but about the value you offer an end-user. The end result: Better MCBW

      <description>About When I was entering my Take 5 year at the University of Rochester, I found myself in a scheduling bind that forbid me from being able to take any of the remaining dance classes I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken.
