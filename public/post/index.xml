      <title>An Open (Love) Letter To My Next Work Partner</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Transparency is paramount. Make sure there are stated objectives (even if they&amp;rsquo;re inaccurate), daily check-ins, and quarterly reviews. Flexibility empowers your people to do the best work they can. Have a bias against policies, rules, and meetings. Trust is your most powerful tool. Get a bunch of good people together, point them in a direction, and get out of the way.   
One of the myriad benefits of having spent so much time working as a contractor is the variety of cultures, work practices, and methodologies employed by various companies.</description>

      <title>UX Considerations For IoT</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Latency and reliability can be a major issue. You should include some sort of manual control (interface or cable). Tech literacy is another concern, especially as IoT products continue to move into the home and gain mainstream adoption. Be aware of your brand experience across all communication modalities (print, mobile, physical).   
Internet of Things (IoT) has been all the rage for a hot second as more and more companies try to bring their devices online and increase access (and functionality) to customers, but it&amp;rsquo;s far too easy for things to go wrong.</description>

      <title>Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts of Corporate Innovation</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of potential in the corporate innovation world, and as the venture market cools, the future of early stage might be corporate. Innovation teams need certain special rules and freedoms compared to the core business, especially in highly regulated industries. Culture and environment are the most important things to define and develop in these settings. Don&amp;rsquo;t settle, and don&amp;rsquo;t let corporate culture interfere.</description>

      <title>Why We&#39;re Firing a Top-Tier Product Development Firm</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Culture trumps credentials, reputation, and pretty much everything else. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to pull the plug on something if it isn&amp;rsquo;t working. Trust your gut and stick to your guns. If you want something done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Just because it has a corporate name tag doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there aren&amp;rsquo;t talented people.   
Some of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing recently has been with what&amp;rsquo;s known as the Business Development branch of a large company.</description>

      <title>The Dangers of Tight Iteration</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/the-dangers-of-tight-iteration/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Getting a lot of feedback quickly isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always the best strategy - having a guiding light is helpful as well. Users react to the level of fidelity of what you show them. You might be missing something if your fidelity doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the issue in the design. Good Product Design (or at least, a good discovery phase/project plan) can alleviate these issues.   
Before starting a new engagement with a client, I always ask a series of questions about their company, their processes, and the project I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on.</description>

      <title>Product vs Project Management</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/product-vs-project-management/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  There&amp;rsquo;s still a fair amount of confusion between product management and project management. Lots of people do the latter well, but the former is often forgotten/forgone. Project Management is focused on execution - securing and organizing resources, planning out tasks, and keeping things on track. Velocity. How. When. Product Management is more about vision - understanding what your users are trying to achieve, having a sense of the big picture, and making sure what&amp;rsquo;s being created fits expectations and needs.</description>

      <title>Back to Static</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Static generators (e.g. Hugo) are pretty cool. Ease of use/production directly relates to content creation. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to borrow aesthetics/technologies/designs from others.   
As you might be able to tell, my last blog post is from 2014. It was about time to get back on the blog horse but also give the site a little facelift. I&amp;rsquo;d migrated blog platforms in the past, but never really took the time to think about how my own personal site was hosted.</description>

      <title>Transparency of &#34;Online&#34;</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/transparency-of-online/</link>

      <description>TL;DNR  Notification design is important, especially in the light of ubiquitous computing. Designing to allow interrupted attention is crucial. Context matters: Users are no longer in a room at a desk on a computer.   
With all the talk about unplugging, disconnecting, screen time, and going &amp;ldquo;off the grid&amp;rdquo;, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly been a shift in the way we interact with technology and the implications it has for society (as well as possibly our mental health).</description>

      <title>Progressive Enhancement with Phonegap</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Enabling native-level functionality on a hosted web app is really cool. Code reuse is also pretty cool. Beware of the gotchas. There are always gotchas.   
Note: This blog post is the long-form answer to this StackOverflow post I made about it (which is, at the time of writing, the #1 Google result for &amp;ldquo;progressive enhancement phonegap&amp;rdquo;). Also worth noting this guide only addresses Android right now.</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to OkCupid</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/an-open-letter-to-okcupid/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/an-open-letter-to-okcupid/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  OkCupid is great, but it&amp;rsquo;s broken. Fixing it should be pretty easy &amp;mdash; just give a fast, simple way to stop bad members from being bad, and let the community sort it out. Empower your users and they&amp;rsquo;ll empower you.   
Dear OkCupid,
I love you. Well, maybe not so much love anymore. I really like you. I really like how you&amp;rsquo;ve made your services free for everyone, and how you&amp;rsquo;re helping people connect and meet others that they never would.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Flow</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/the-importance-of-flow/</link>

      <description>TL;DNR  Pop-ups are distracting. Design your life to have less sudden distractions and you&amp;rsquo;ll be more productive and happier. Desiging user experiences that encourage flow are good.   
I&amp;rsquo;ve become more and more interested in Flow recently. As a psych major, flow is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of for a long time, but I always thought of it as something that just happens, and never gave it much thought.</description>

      <title>Foursquare Heatmap &amp; Remote Sensing</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Foursquare&amp;rsquo;s API and Google Maps are pretty easy to work with. Creating a new product can be as easy as combining two existing technologies. New products create opportunities for new experiences.   
A little over a month ago (technically during the Foursquare Hackathon, but I was working from home due to Red Eye) I spent a few hours one weekend hacking together an idea I&amp;rsquo;d come up with when working on Foursquare integration for Trinker.</description>

      <description>TL;DNR  Memory is fallible, and humans tend to remember the most intense part and the ending of any experience. Finding systems that work for you is essential to productivity. Limit the number of choices a user has to (or has the opportunity to) make. Choose smart defaults and hide most options.   
I have a habit when it comes to books. When I read a book, I almost always underline/take notes in the margin.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Content</title>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/the-importance-of-content/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Content is just as important to UX as aesthetics. Without content, your site (and all of its functionality and pretty design) is worthless. Trying to stay up to date with blog posts is hard.   
I&amp;rsquo;m going to say this straight out of the gates: this blog post is kind of a cop-out. There have been a ton of changes in my life lately, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little MIA when it comes to this blog.</description>

      <title>DITW: Stovetop</title>
      <link>http://bradorego.com/ditw-stovetop/</link>

      <guid>http://bradorego.com/ditw-stovetop/</guid>
      <description>TL;DNR  Sometimes things we interact with in the physical world are poorly designed. Direct mapping makes a lot more sense, and should be used whenever/wherever possible. Just because people are used to a certain design/solution does not mean it&amp;rsquo;s the optimal. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to start from scratch.   
Sometimes we come across things that, until we see an alternative, we don&amp;rsquo;t realize there&amp;rsquo;s something better than the current option.</description>

      <title>New Site!</title>

      <description>TL;DNR  Drupal is cool, powerful, mature. Making it easier to create content is important to how likely it is to happen. Keeping up with technology and the design community is important.   
It only took me about 10 months, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to rebuilding this site to have a purpose. I originally built a personal website when I was leaving Epic with the intention of having a place to show my past work as well as a place to play around with new technologies on the web.</description>
