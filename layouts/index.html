        <p class="my-0"><strong>Dec 12 Update: There are more showcase items coming and they'll have more detail (aside from just being lifted from a slide deck), however I wanted to get these out the door before we get too close to the holidays to schedule interviews.</strong><br><br>I am currently actively seeking opportunities in Senior+ (Lead, Staff, Principal, etc.) User Research or in UX Leadership (Manager, Director, VP, etc.). <br/><br/>Specifically, I'm looking for opportunities where a company is looking to start/scale a Research practice or are looking to formalize and organize their existing Research/UX team so that I can implement a number of best practices identified by the ResearchOps community.<p>
