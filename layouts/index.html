        <p class="my-0"><strong>Mar 2 Update: There are more showcase items coming and they'll have more detail (aside from just being lifted from a slide deck), however my motivation to do so is pretty low right now.</strong><br><br>I recently started working with <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a> to help them build and scale a Research team from scratch, so a) this portfolio is fairly useless for the immediate future, and b) most of my time and energy will be spent there. <br><br>I would suggest following along the blog in the meantime, as I'll be writing a lot about my work there üòÅ.<p>
