## What _is_ User Experience Research/Design?
Many times throughout my career, I've been asked to define what a User Experience team/practice consists of. Recently, I've been moving away from "UX" as a term (as it tends to focus people too much on technology), instead preferring "human-centered" as the prefix. To me, human-centered design has very little to do with making things pretty (though aesthetics are important), and is more about an iterative, explorative process to understand what the needs and desires of your audience/users are and to deliver a simple, elegant solution to those problems.

Research is a crucial part of the process. By leveraging research at every stage (from exploration and ideation through prototyping, implementation, and launch) and borrowing elements of service design, we can ensure the solutions built work not only for the isolated use case but as part of the larger ecosystem they fit into. By constantly leveraging feedback and data generated by interactions with end users, I ensure that not only are we solving the right problem, but that we're solving it the right way.
