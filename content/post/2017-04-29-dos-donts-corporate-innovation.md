As some of you may know, I've been spending some time working in the corporate innovation team of a large Fortune 500 company. I was hesitant to take the role consdering I've spent the majority of my career thus far with early stage startups, but the opportunity seemed interesting and worth exploring. After 6 months, I've learned that, while my hesitations were warranted, there's also a lot of potential.

This post is going to serve as a sort of stand-in for a talk I was going to give at InsureTechATX on the eve of this year's SXSW. Why this is necessary will come up later.

# Do: Provide Resources <a name="resources" href="#resources"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### But don't limit yourself to thinking "resource" === "money".

During the first conversation I had with my manager-to-be when discussing my long-term role in this group and the upcoming potential, he dropped something casually in conversation that I nearly fell out of my chair over. Essentially, that there were plans to acquire up to 3 companies at an up to 9 figure pricetag each. When he noticed my look of incredulity, he added "Oh, don't worry. You'll get used to that here."

A week or two later, an email came through addressed to everyone on the team that laid out our AWS costs. Our astute SysAdmin had noticed a large portion of the servers we were paying for were either completely idle or severely underutilized, and that the cost for those was in the $40k/month ballpark. Commence further chair-falling.

One of the most obvious benefits to working in corporate innovation is the budget. My entire career has been working in a situation where we have no time and no money and about a thousand things that need to get done. The ability to focus solely on your job and to spare no expense in doing so is incredibly powerful. However, don't limit yourself to just money.

As I got further into working in this environment, I learned of what's arguably more valuable than piles of cash: access to customers, domain expertise, and data. Some of our most useful lessons came from talking to someone within the company that had been working in a given area for years and had all the insights we needed. It was like customer validation on steroids.

Another thing that came up was the ability to purchase data sets (or data streams). Want to build a tool to assess risk based on weather? That's cool. We can buy access to a few data streams and smash it all together with other high-powered (and expensive) analytics tools. Who cares if it costs a few million dollars a year if it has the potential to save the company 10-100x that?

# Don't: Let Ego Get In The Way <a name="ego" href="#ego"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Openness, transparency, and growth are paramount.

One of the dangers of having so much resource available is it's easy to feel too comfortable, and it's easy for people to fall back into old ways of being, thinking, and doing. When you have newcomers to this environment, and they have different ways of thinking or working, this can cause tension. Creating a culture of transparency, openness, and candor is how you fight this.

In the startup world, this way of thinking is almost assumed due to the pressures and deadlines being exerted on the company. There's no time for glad-handing or making sure you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CYA">CYA</a> when everything is on fire. If someone isn't doing something they need to (or is doing something they don't need to), it becomes immediately apparent and is usually dealt with almost as immediately.

Obviously there's something to be said about tact, but if you hire good people (see below), you can assume if they're saying something it's for the benefit of the company and of the team. Don't let a culture creep up where fragile egos (or, even worse, apathy) get in the way of progress and growth. Encourage your team to questione everything and to always be pushing themselves and each other.

# Do: Set Deadlines, Goals, and Incentives <a name="goals" href="#goals"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Accountability is key. Stage gating is your friend.

When there are no external deadlines and no burn rate to keep a team motivated, it can be easy to let things slide and to become complacent. Complacency is the death of a startup. By definining what exactly the goal of each activity is and setting clear expectations, not only can you keep everyone moving forward, but in many ways this helps getting out of people's ways (see below).

One of the things I was introduced to (although we didn't really implement) was the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-gate_process">stage-/phase-gating</a>. Essentially, you define a set of goals, a set timeframe, and a budget for whatever phase (or stage) the team/product is currently in. By doing so, you make it clear what the objective is and what resources (time, money, people) the team has available to achieve those goals. If there are any further requirements, you can lay those out at this point as well, but I would recommend being as flexible with these as possible.

If the team achieves the goals by the given date, they are successful. If they fail, you can start looking into why they failed (was the gate too ambitious? did they learn something new that changed things? did they mismanage resources?) and then make a decision on whether to continue with the project or to, and this is important, roll those individuals off onto another project.

You can also tie incentives to those stage gates. In traditional settings, it's easy to define whether someone is under- or outperforming their peers. On an innovation team, this is harder to identify. Instead of focusing on the individual, reward the entire team for achieving a goal, especially if they do so without spending all of the budget they were allotted. If someone on the team isn't pulling their weight, the team will handle it.

Stage gates have the added benefit of preventing <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/zombie-projects-how-to-find-them-and-kill-them">zombie projects</a> (another term I discovered in the corporate world). If every project has a specific set of goals and timeline, the opportunity for that project to continue on without end.

# Don't: Let Policy (or Process) Interfere With Progress <a name="policy" href="#policy"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Hire good people and get out of their way.

# Do: Let Your People Tell Their Story <a name="story" href="#story"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Your best asset is your team.

#### The biggest challenge is attracting and retaining talent.

I haven't decided if this brief foray into corporate innovation will be my last, but hopefully the shock of coming from the wild west of early stage startupland into a corporate environment has opened some eyes and bring about change. I'm always happy to talk about my experience if anyone's interested. Feel free to <a href="mailto:me@bradorego.com">reach out</a>.
