Before starting a new engagement with a client, I always ask a series of questions about their company, their processes, and the project I'll be working on. One of those questions asks how they're currently handling user research and product design and I'm often told they "have a tight feedback loop" and that's all they have to say.

There's a lot wrong with this answer, but let's unpack it a little.

# Rapid Prototyping

Rapid prototyping is good! Much better than doing nothing. Here are some tools/practices (paper, wizard of oz, testing your competitors, )

# Let's talk about fidelity

Users respond to the level of fidelity. If you give them paper, they'll tell you about workflow, concepts, features, etc. If you give them images, they'll talk about colors, spacing, etc. If you give them a functioning prototype, they'll talk about performance, interactivity, transitions, etc.


# Why it matters

It can be intoxicating to set a baseline and watch your numbers improve on whatever metrics you've set, as you iterate. Arguably, data-informed design is a good thing, especially compared to the alternative. The <a href="http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/data-informed-not-data-driven-the-subtext/">problem</a> is when data starts driving your decisions, and you lose sight of the big picture - improving the experience for the end user. Increased conversions, decreased errors, or more efficient interactions may not necessarily be the most enjoyable experience (e.g. a <a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/rbuell/papers/buell_norton_2011.pdf">wait time</a> might actually be a _good_ thing).

The problem with this approach is it might be honing in on what's known as a local maxima. Naive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill-climbing</a> algorithms can fall victim to this problem as well. Essentially, you continue to see improvements and make changes until you reach a point where those improvements either diminish entirely or degrade. At this point, traditional wisdom would be to stop working and either a) work on something else, or b) declare yourself victorious and toast your achievement, all the while missing what could be a better solution.

On a philosophical note, I like to think of every design problem (if not every problem in life) as something like the above graphic, except the plane is infinite -- there're always other options, some of which might be better than our current situation if we're just willing to take the leap of faith and try a new approach.

# Fighting the Local Maxima

So now we're aware of the problem and what causes it. That doesn't necessarily tell us what to do about it, though. Here's a great strategy outlined in an article from 2010:

<blockquote>
  One strategy we might employ is to optimize until we reach a point of diminishing returns: design until changes just aren’t having a big effect. Then, stop optimizing and return to other kinds of analysis to figure out the next steps. Conduct interviews. Do user testing. Give surveys, ask questions. Find out the biggest existing pain points instead of focusing on tiny design elements at this stage. Focus at the activity-level. What are people trying to accomplish? What are their higher-level goals? What aren’t people doing that we want them to? What big hurdles keep them from taking the next action? This level of insight will allow you to make those bigger changes.

I couldn't've said it better myself.
