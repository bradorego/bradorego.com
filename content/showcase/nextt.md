# Background

Nextt was a collaborative social planning tool. Nextt's goal was to make it easier to plan social events for 4-10 people within the next 14 days, and the service did so by allowing users to create and share event Ideas that, once the date/time, location, and attendees were finalized, transitioned into a Plan. If the Idea did not reach fruition within a preset amount of time, it would self-destruct, forcing the user to take action. I joined the team in 2013 as their UX Lead, responsible for research, analytics, and UX design. Nextt raised $1.2M in VC funding and eventually shut down in October 2014.

# Method

I was responsible for designing and overseeing implementation of our analytics suite, as well as for developing a design practice for the company. Analytics were implemented in Mixpanel, and were used to track all actions within the application (iOS, Android, and web), which we used to iterate on designs. On top of analytics data, I also ran in-person usability studies to gather qualitative feedback about proposed designs and features.

Alongside our design practice, I was also involved in strategic and marketing initiatives, including in-person focus groups, survey design, and email marketing. We held several focus groups to explore different problem spaces and discover which audience had the most acute problems, settling on young professionals.

I used all of this information to make adjustments to Nextt's agile product development process, injecting data and research much earlier than previously possible which allowed us to make better decisions and re-prioritize.

# Design

In my role with Nextt, I provided UX Lead and Mobile Web Development services, which on top of writing all of the web code that eventually became the Android app (via PhoneGap), I also took over wireframing and prototyping and implemented a usability practice including focus groups, usability studies, weekly surveys, and analytics suites.

Nextt had a part-time graphic designer to add a lot of the finesse and final touches to the designs, but the majority of app layout and user flow was my doing. I made the final call on visual design decisions before they were presented to the C-suite, working closely with the graphic designer.

# Results

Under my guidance, we improved completion of our onboarding by 19% and improved conversion rate on invites (to events from current users) by 46%. We also rolled out a hybrid web application to Android and mobile browsers built entirely using vanilla Javascript. We also gathered hundreds of data points across a dozen email surveys and conducted over 15 in-person usability studies.
