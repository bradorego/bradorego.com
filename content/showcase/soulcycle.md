   "description": "SoulCycle revolutionized the indoor cycling experience, and in 2014, reached out to Prolific Interactive to help imagine and actualize an iOS app to match and build upon that experience. I joined Prolific in 2018 and inherited the role of UX Researcher on this project, which gave me the opportunity to own research for the entire (Digital) Product team. On top of supporting several work streams, I've also been guiding product strategy, developing a research practice, and educating Soul's Product Managers and Product Designers on the importance of research and how to conduct their own.",
