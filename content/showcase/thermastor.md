# About

Therma-Stor is a high-end dehumidifier, water heater, and disaster recovery/restoration manufacturer established in 1977. Most of their products are focused on commercial applications, but recently they’ve been expanding into the high-end residential space with some of their units. With that move they were also interested in bringing their products online to offer internet-enabled options.

With so many examples of IoT products gone wrong, and all the ways one can go wrong, the opportunity to get in on the ground level of taking a product online is extremely valuable. Therma-Stor’s years of experience with their products and their consumers served as the basis of our exploration and design, and our expertise in software guided product development. Our first use case targeted agents monitoring multiple devices across different properties, with future development to target direct-to-consumer models as well as providing better reporting and visualization tools to account managing hundreds of units (desktop dashboard wireframes included; under development).

Therma-Stor’s Santa Fe Sentry application is currently available on both iOS and Android, the Classic II application is under development, and the desktop web/native desktop applications are in research stages.
