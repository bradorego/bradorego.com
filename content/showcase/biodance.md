# About

When I was entering my <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/students/opportunities/takefive/">Take 5</a> year at the <a href="http://rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a>, I found myself in a scheduling bind that forbid me from being able to take any of the remaining dance classes I hadn't taken. Between this and my desire to push my dance career beyond academia, I decided to propose an independent study with Missy Pfohl Smith, the newly appointed Director of the <a href="http://rochester.edu/college/dance">Program of Dance &amp; Movement</a>. The path this independent study lead me down was somewhere between unexpected and incredible.

Given the experience to intern with <a href="http://biodance.com">Biodance</a> as well as stage manage their Fall 2010 production at Geva Theater, I learned much more about dance "in the real world" than I had expected. On top of the hands-on experience of professional rehearsals and stage management for a live show, I was also blessed with the opportunities to learn about the logistics of running a dance company, such as grant writing, proofreading, marketing, and preparing/disseminating press releases.

The full text of my capstone essay can be found <a href="http://old.bradorego.com/sites/default/files/docs/dan381.pdf">here</a>. Photos include highlights from the show I stage managed.
