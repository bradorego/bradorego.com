   "description": "1010data has been a leader in big data analytics since 2000. In 2019, I joined 1010 as their first Director of User Experience in order to design, implement, and lead a department focused on human-centered research and design. By working cross-functionally, generating consensus, and implementing new rituals, practices, methods, and tools, I empowered my team to deliver best-in-class user experiences by leveraging data to guide our process.",

     "There are unique benefits and challenges to starting from scratch, especially at a well-established company. 1010 has an eager appetite for being data-informed and for being more human-centric, however there was both a hesitation as well as corporate inertia to overcome in shifting methods and culture.",
     "Before joining 1010, I was under the impression there was virtually nobody outside of Sales talking to end users. This turned out to be completely false; we had plenty of feedback coming in, but no pipeline to deliver it to stakeholders on the Product side. Clearing this up was a major win for research.",

The more you can collaborate, the more you can all achieve, and by co-leading initiatives, tremendous value can be delivered."
