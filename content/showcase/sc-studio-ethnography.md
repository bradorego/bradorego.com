   "description": "SoulCycle revolutionized the indoor cycling experience, and in 2014, reached out to Prolific Interactive to help imagine and actualize an iOS app to match and build upon that experience. I joined Prolific in 2018 and inherited the role of UX Researcher on this project, which gave me the opportunity to own research for the entire (Digital) Product team. On top of supporting several work streams, I supported product strategy, developed a research practice, and educated Soul's stakeholders, ultimately guiding their transition to hire their first in-house Researcher in 2019.",
