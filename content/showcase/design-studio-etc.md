# About

Design Studio Etc. ("etc") is an architectural design firm headquarted in Madison, WI with over 30 years of design and consulting experience. etc's work is featured all over Madison, greater Wisconsin, and even other areas of the country such as Illinois, Arizona, and California.

etc's former website was a flat set of three pages which left the user with virtually no idea of what the company actually was/did. The "about" page was the only way to glean any real information, and the design was dominated by an image that had very little value-add. Within a course of a couple weeks, the entire brand identity, look and feel, and design of the website was turned around (with the help and incredible energy of the client).

The new website features responsive design, a fluid layout, image slideshows (with lightbox for greater detail), and three structured subsections of the website (about, "what we do" (aka projects), and "on the boards" (aka blog)). The new look aligns with etc's new identity, and provides a modern website to carry the company forward while making edits and updates easy via Drupal's admin interface.
