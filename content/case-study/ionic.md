# About

The Ionic Framework was <a href="http://blog.ionic.io/announcing-ionic/">first released</a> in October 2013 and has since taken the hybrid app development world by storm, recently announcing their <a href="http://blog.ionic.io/announcing-ionics-8-5m-series-a/">Series A</a>. I built my first full-fledged Ionic app in earnest almost a year after the platform was announced. Since then, I've worked with companies to build dozens of Ionic apps for everything from pure prototypes to production-level applications.

In particular, here's a short list of Ionic apps I've built for my own purposes.

# NewsFlash News App

NewsFlash was built using what was, at the time, a brand new feature in Ionic: swipable cards. I'd done some work to take a demo the core team put together and enabled bi-directional swiping, and then added a little more code to allow a developer to know which direction a user swiped (the core team only offered a callback for when it was swiped) (also worth noting that both of these features are now part of the core offering).

The idea behind NewsFlash was that I never got around to reading any content on my RSS feeds. Even in the days of <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/about/">Google Reader</a>, my list of feeds always left me with hundreds of articles to read and no good way to sort through what was interesting. Given the recent fame of the Tinder-style swipe interaction, I had the idea to create "Tinder for RSS". Add your feeds, swipe right to save the stories you care about, left to discard them. The app keeps track of what you've previously saved so you have one place to manage your reading list. See a quick demo below:

# TrackMe Personal Tracker

TrackMe came out of a frustration with other tracking apps as well as inspiration from Nick Felton, who's been tracking his life in various ways and producing infographics <a href='http://feltron.com/FAR05.html'>as far back as 2005</a>. The thought is: if we have an easy way to track anything, and we store this data, we can use something like <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> to generate interactive infographics.

TrackMe is another example of a minimalist application - one whose design is simple and purpose is singulary. Users create items to track, and then add individual entries to update the total value of whatever they're tracking. Positive, negative, integer, whole number; mileage, reps, money spent, time spent - the application doesn't care what you're tracking. It's up to you to track. Eventually, we'll be offering a set of tools to build whatever infographics you want as well.

# Better MCBW

Better MCBW has its own entire post explaining the motivation and process. You can read more about it <a href="/2016-05-better-mcbw/">here</a>. Better MCBW has seen a decent amount of traction among Madison Craft Beer Week participants despite the entire motivation being my own.
