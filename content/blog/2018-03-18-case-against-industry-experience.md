For those that haven't been keeping track, I recently (October 2017) moved from Madison, WI to Brooklyn, NY, and the difference in the tech industry between the two cities has been really interesting. I've noticed something in particular that's slightly disconcerting, so I wanted to take some time to address it. Most job posts ask for/require prior experience in their specific industry, which I think is introducing (persisting) biases in the products we design.

# The Case <em>For</em> Experience <a name="case-for" href="#case-for"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### There are clear benefits to having some experience.

Before we get too far down the rabbit hole, let's touch briefly on the benefits of hiring product people that have some industry experience:

* Familiarity with how things operate (industry-specific terminology, user types, business models, subject matter expertise, etc).
* A shared knowledge of work environments/styles (e.g. agile vs. waterfall, lean UX, guerrilla UX).
* Having "seen this before", whether that be specifically for your industry or in general.

I'm not saying only hire recent grads (anything but). What I am saying, though, is that having someone that's new to your industry is going to create many opportunities.

# Fighting Bias <a name="bias" href="#bias"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Diversity is the killer of bias.

As much as you can try, nobody can fully escape their biases. Our brains have built in heuristics for how we see the world and process information which makes it impossible to be bias-free. The best way to combat bias and its negative influence on your product is to build a diverse team and encourage radical candor. (links for radical candor, diversity)

A diverse team (both in terms of thought and background) allows everyone to see how others think and interpret information, and a culture of openness, honesty, and radical candor lets everyone feel comfortable calling out that bias. It's important to do this without blame, though; people rarely hold biases (especially detrimental ones) on purpose. It's a side effect of their upbringing, how they've been taught, the people they've been around, etc. There's no need to make a big deal out of someone's bias, but you can point them out so everyone can move forward.

# Being a Good Learner <a name="good-learner" href="#good-learner"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### ABL. Always. Be. Learning. Encourage the beginner mindset.

There are things you can do to create a culture of the beginner mindset. Question everything, identify assumptions, and work through them. Have a framework in place; make it formulaic and part of a process. (links for techniques)

Make sure you're not personally falling into theory blindness. Young doctors are actually often better than old due to more training and a willingness to question everything. Once you give someone a theory, they cling to it, missing information they otherwise see. (links for theory blindness/expertise error)
