  <h4>TL;DNR</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>There's a lot of discussion around whether designers should code. Here's my take on it.</li>
    <li>As a designer, having at least a vague idea of how the technology behind the products you're working on is beneficial.</li>
    <li>There may be certain quirks based on implementation, but overall the pattern is Database --> Server-side --> (API) --> (Middleware) --> Front-End --> Visual/UI Design</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Outline:
Database (mongo, sql, etc)
Server-side (python, perl, RoR, node/monolith vs microservices vs job queue)
API layer (what the front end talks to)
Middleware
Front-End (js; angular, vue, react. ignoring android/ios)
Visual/UI (html, css, js)
(UX)
