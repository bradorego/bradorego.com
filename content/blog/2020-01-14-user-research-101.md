My life changed fundamentally in the Fall of 2008. I was entering my 3rd year at the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu) where I was double-majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. Up until that point, these were two things I studied in parallel, and had yet to discover the niche they intersect in. That is, until [Carman Neustaedter](https://carmster.com/), then working as a Research Scientist at Kodak in Rochester, taught a class as an adjunct called "Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction". Since then, I've been applying my training and knowledge in Research Psychology to the domain of technology. After designing and running hundreds of studies, working with dozens of companies and mentees, and chatting with my talented and passionate colleagues in [ResearchOps](https://researchops.community), I've discovered an underlying framework to impactful user research.

# 7 Steps to Effective User Research <a name="7steps" href="#7steps"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Cover all of your bases for impactful outcomes and great glory.

We'll dive into each of these elements in detail later, but I wanted to first present the 7 (technically 8, though I say 7 because the 0th step is only necessary when stepping into a new vertical, role, or company) facets of the framework together as a unit and give a little context of how I got here.

The framework, in all of its imperfect glory, follows:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////// image?? /////// cycle?
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

<ol start="0">
   <li>Understand the Context</li>
   <li>Align on Goals</li>
   <li>Determine Strategy</li>
   <li>Plan and Execute</li>
   <li>Analyze Results</li>
   <li>Document Findings</li>
   <li>Share it</li>
   <li>Iterate</li>
</ol>

As to how I got here, it's been part of my personal evolution as a practitioner. I'm certainly not the most qualified individual when it comes to raw research methodology, statistical strength, etc., but coming out of an Honors program in Psychology, I had a certain degree of confidence in my experimental design and analysis. The parts I've really had to learn the hard way are everything that aren't #3 and #4, which are much more related to the business end of research. The process of selecting goals, determining methods, and documenting and sharing results is strikingly different in the realm of academia, and there are unique challenges to research in that context as well as in the industry.

Planning and executing research itself is usually the easiest part of being a Researcher in the industry. It's the part we're good at. All of the other elements are where I've fallen short in the past, and where I see teams falling short still, which is why I wanted to highlight the non-hardcore-research things that go into doing impactful research. If you want a deep dive into how to select research methodologies, there's a ton of materials out there. I'd start with [Nielsen Norman Group's primer on the topic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/).

# Step 0: Understand the Context <a name="context" href="#context"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### What space are you playing/working in, and what are the unique challenges and opportunities?

The reason this is a Step 0 is twofold. Firstly, it's absolutely essential to running an effective research practice. You need to know who the stakeholders are, what your product/service/company's unique positioning is, what the pressures are, who your allies are, etc. This will greatly impact your strategic decisions (step 2), as a large portion of what determines your methodology are your constraints. There are a variety of ways to do this, but the most effective way is to just talk to your colleagues.

One of the most influential things I've started doing when I join a new team, a new organization, or start a new project, is what I refer to as a "Listening & Learning Tour" (terminology which I've borrowed lovingly from my alma mater's 11th President, [Sarah Mangelsdorf](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/off-and-running-sarah-mangelsdorf-sets-her-own-presidential-tone/)). In a nutshell, I set up meetings with as many people as I possibly can across every discipline/area of expertise I can and at every level of the organization. I walk into the meeting with essentially 3 agenda items:

1. Introduction to me and to User Research.
2. Tell me about the work you do, and how can Research help support your goals.
3. How might you be able to help the Research team accomplish our goals?

The benefits to this approach are vast and deep. It's an informal chat, so people are generally disarmed. You also get to use the "Hi I'm new here help me understand" cover. It's also an excellent opportunity to begin developing rapport and identifying who your powerful allies may be. It has an added benefit of educating and evangelizing Research to the team as well, which helps your team understand what it is you do and how to engage with you. The real purpose, however, is to gather whatever intel you can about the environment you're stepping into. This is part of why it's so important to talk to many disciplines and many levels: you want to triangulate as much as possible, and getting a diverse set of opinions and perspectives is crucial to this.

The second reason it's #0 on the list is that, as you may've guessed by now, this isn't something you need to do every single time. It's more of a foundational step than a practical step in the research process. If you already know who the key players are, what your market position is, and who you can leverage to accomplish your goals, there's no sense in rehashing that, and you can move forward with Step 1. Skipping this step, however, can be catastrophic, and is a mistake I've made far too many times myself.

# Step 1: Align on Goals <a name="goals" href="#goals"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Make sure everyone is on the same page as to what you're trying to accomplish and how research can help.

Another step that is far too often overlooked (especially by more junior team members) is to ensure there's alignment with the team and key stakeholders before moving forward with any research activities. Typically, this is how things work:

1. Somebody (usually a PM) decides they want some research to help them make a decision.
2. They ask the researcher to go to some research.
3. Researcher gets real excited and immediately gets to work.
4. Researcher designs a study, recruits participants, executes the study, analyzes results, and prepares for a presentation.
5. Researcher shares their findings with the team, and is met with blank stares.
6. Original requester says something along the lines of "Why did you do that? This isn't what I asked for".
7. ðŸ¤¬

The key breakdown in the above scenario is all the way at the beginning. The next time somebody asks you for research, the first thing you should do is ask Why. Using the "[Five Whys]()" is a good way to get at the root cause of what's being asked for, and will clarify the needs both for you and for your team. This type of alignment up front will help avoid wasting a lot of time down the road.

Two other questions I tend to ask that are really powerful and insightful are around the business needs and around the decision-making process. Essentially, you want to make sure everyone is on the same page of what you'll do based on the results of your research. You can more or less build a [decision tree]() that will guide decisions based on the results of your research. This has an added benefit of making the value and impact of research much clearer and more concrete, which is particularly beneficial when it comes time to talk about resourcing and/or promotions.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/////////// image decision tree ///////

In terms of business goals (or the "bottom line"), I have an [entire blog post]() about how to ensure your activities are aligning with KPIs for your organization. You should read all of that if you want details, but the 15-second version is that you should make sure the decisions that will be made based on your research impact one of 4 key business levers: Acquisition, Retention, Cost to Serve, or Outreach. It's not necessarily up to you to decide which of those are important (that's more a Product decision), but doing research that doesn't ladder back up to that is an easy way to let your impact slip and devalue research activities.

# Step 2: Determine Research Strategy <a name="strategy" href="#strategy"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Let your context, goals, and constraints guide which methods to use.

Once you have a clear picture of what the intended outcomes are, you can move forward with picking out a strategy. Strategy is one of the hardest parts of being a researcher, and usually the skill that develops last in one's development as a practitioner, so don't worry if this seems nebulous.

In a nutshell, your research strategy is how you'll actually do the research. This includes methodology, research questions, your script, and your target population. A variety of factors go into determining your strategy, but there are really only two key factors:

1. Desired Outcomes
2. Constraints

Desired Outcomes is a combination of the conversations you had in Step 1 to clarify what's being asked and what the team will do with the results as well as your knowledge and expertise as a Researcher. You need to be cognizant of what types of feedback you need to gather to answer the questions you have. Is this attitudinal or behavioral research? Should you look for quantitative or qualitative feedback? Is the goal evaluative or generative insights? All research activities will vary on these dimensions, among others.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///// image constraints funny?
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The other key factor is what your constraints are, and they can come in virtually infinite forms. Constriants can be resources (financial or human capital), political, temporal, capacity, capability, historical, access...the list goes on. What you need to be mindful of is how to maneuver within whatever constraints you are facing, as it's virtually unheard of you'll be able to use the exact method with the exact population and the exact timeframe you want. Research in industry is all about doing the best you can with what you have.

Another factor that is often undervalued when it comes to strategy and can be a complete dealbreaker is who you're talking to. Population and participant selection are essential to study design. The questions you ask and the method you use almost don't matter if you're talking to the wrong people. Ensure the people you're using as participants are appropriate for the end goals.

# Step 3: Plan & Execute <a name="plan" href="#plan"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Gather all of the resources and materials you need and do the actual research.

3) Plan and execute. Find and get access to those people. Figure out what you'll ask them to do. Do it. Be wary of bias and noise and all of the other bullshit.

# Step 4: Analyze Results <a name="analyze" href="#analyze"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Extract the key insights, major trends, and impacts to your decision tree.

4) analyze the results. Who did you talk to? How? What did you learn? What are the major trends? What surprised you? What themes emerged and how does it compare to your hypotheses?

# Step 5: Document Findings <a name="document" href="#document"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### If it's not written down, did it even happen?

5) document the learnings. Put your analysis into multiple forms, for both short and long term analysis. How does it impact your immediate work? How does it inform longer term outcomes? How does it change the way you approach research going forward?

# Step 6: Share It! <a name="share" href="#share"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Tell everyone you possibly can in as many media and modalities you possibly can. Evangelism is crucial.

6) share it. High and low. Near, far, and wide. Tell your team. Tell your neighbor. Put it on Slack. Put it in your newsletter. Do a viewing party.

# Step 7: Iterate <a name="iterate" href="#iterate"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Take time to have a retrospective on the study you just conducted and see what you can do better next time.

7) iterate. How could you have done better? What would make it more impactful? How might you share results more concisely? How did it impact your archetypes? What should you do next for your product team?

# Conclusion <a name="conclusion" href="#conclusion"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Now that you have a framework, make it your own.
