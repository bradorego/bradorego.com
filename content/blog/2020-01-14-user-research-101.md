      "After a decade in the industry with the academic underpinnings of research psychology, I've discovered the basic framework of successful research activities in the tech sector (and, I would guess, in other sectors as well).",
      "The more you can standardize and systematize your processes, the more efficient and consistent activities will be. This is especially true of research: by going through the checklist and making sure you have all 7 elements covered, you can deliver higher quality results.",
      "This framework is a good way for more-junior team members to start to think through the full spectrum of strategic user research. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but this should give you the basis to have conversations with your team."

My life changed fundamentally in the Fall of 2008. I was entering my 3rd year at the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu) where I was double-majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. Up until that point, these were two things I studied in parallel, and had yet to discover the niche they intersect in. That is, until [Carman Neustaedter](https://carmster.com/), then working as a Research Scientist at Kodak in Rochester, taught a class as an adjunct called "Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction". Since then, I've been applying my training and knowledge in Research Psychology to the domain of technology. After designing and running hundreds of studies, working with dozens of companies and mentees, and chatting with my talented and passionate colleagues in [ResearchOps](https://researchops.community), I've discovered an underlying framework to impactful user research.

# 7 Steps to Effective User Research <a name="7steps" href="#7steps"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Cover all of your bases for impactful outcomes and great glory.

We'll dive into each of these elements in detail later, but I wanted to first present the 7 (technically 8, though I say 7 because the 0th step is only necessary when stepping into a new vertical, role, or company) facets of the framework together as a unit and give a little context of how I got here.

The framework, in all of its imperfect glory, follows:

<ol start="0">
   <li>Understand the Context</li>
   <li>Align on Goals</li>
   <li>Determine Strategy</li>
   <li>Plan and Execute</li>
   <li>Analyze Results</li>
   <li>Document Findings</li>
   <li>Share it</li>
   <li>Iterate</li>
</ol>

As to how I got here, it's been part of my personal evolution as a practitioner. I'm certainly not the most qualified individual when it comes to raw research methodology, statistical strength, etc., but coming out of an Honors program in Psychology, I had a certain degree of confidence in my experimental design and analysis. The parts I've really had to learn the hard way are everything that aren't #3 and #4, which are much more related to the business end of research. The process of selecting goals, determining methods, and documenting and sharing results is strikingly different in the realm of academia, and there are unique challenges to research in that context as well as in the industry.

Planning and executing research itself is usually the easiest part of being a Researcher in the industry. It's the part we're good at. All of the other elements are where I've fallen short in the past, and where I see teams falling short still, which is why I wanted to highlight the non-hardcore-research things that go into doing impactful research. If you want a deep dive into how to select research methodologies, there's a ton of materials out there. I'd start with [Nielsen Norman Group's primer on the topic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/).

# Step 0: Understand the Context <a name="context" href="#context"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### What space are you playing/working in, and what are the unique challenges and opportunities?

0) understand the context, including the industry, the company's position, the stakeholders, and your products position

# Step 1: Align on Goals <a name="goals" href="#goals"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Make sure everyone is on the same page as to what you're trying to accomplish and how research can help.

1) identify goals and outcomes of research. What will you do with it? How will it impact decisions? How will it affect the bottom line? Make a decision tree

# Step 2: Determine Research Strategy <a name="strategy" href="#strategy"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Let your context, goals, and constraints guide which methods to use.

2) figure out your strategy. What types of questions are you trying to answer? How much time do you have? What's your budget? What types of data do you need to obtain? Who will you talk to?

# Step 3: Plan & Execute <a name="plan" href="#plan"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Gather all of the resources and materials you need and do the actual research.

3) Plan and execute. Find and get access to those people. Figure out what you'll ask them to do. Do it. Be wary of bias and noise and all of the other bullshit.

# Step 4: Analyze Results <a name="analyze" href="#analyze"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Extract the key insights, major trends, and impacts to your decision tree.

4) analyze the results. Who did you talk to? How? What did you learn? What are the major trends? What surprised you? What themes emerged and how does it compare to your hypotheses?

# Step 5: Document Findings <a name="document" href="#document"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### If it's not written down, did it even happen?

5) document the learnings. Put your analysis into multiple forms, for both short and long term analysis. How does it impact your immediate work? How does it inform longer term outcomes? How does it change the way you approach research going forward?

# Step 6: Share It! <a name="share" href="#share"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Tell everyone you possibly can in as many media and modalities you possibly can. Evangelism is crucial.

6) share it. High and low. Near, far, and wide. Tell your team. Tell your neighbor. Put it on Slack. Put it in your newsletter. Do a viewing party.

# Step 7: Iterate <a name="iterate" href="#iterate"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Take time to have a retrospective on the study you just conducted and see what you can do better next time.

7) iterate. How could you have done better? What would make it more impactful? How might you share results more concisely? How did it impact your archetypes? What should you do next for your product team?

# Conclusion <a name="conclusion" href="#conclusion"><i class="ion-link"></i></a>
#### Now that you have a framework, make it your own.
